We are big fans of versatile pieces and when we find one that ticks all our boxes, we get really excited. Ghanaian fashion brand SIKA just released a new collection in collaboration with author and broadcaster Afua Hirsch and quite frankly, we are obsessed! With the weather getting warmer and sunnier days ahead in this part of the world, the pieces from this Afua x Sika collection are the perfect outfits to add to your rotation. What’s more? Each piece was handmade in Ghana with Batik cotton and designed into gorgeous dresses that would compliment every body type. Check out our top picks from the collection: <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1168054 lazyloaded" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH.jpg?resize=2500%2C3748&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="2500" height="3748" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH.jpg?resize=2500%2C3748&#038;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH.jpg?resize=2500%2C3748&#038;ssl=1 2500w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KCDRESSHIGH-683x1024.jpg 683w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class=" alignnone size-full wp-image-1168053 lazyloading" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2.jpg?resize=2500%2C3966&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="2500" height="3966" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2.jpg?resize=2500%2C3966&#038;ssl=1" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2.jpg?resize=2500%2C3966&#038;ssl=1 2500w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2-768x1218.jpg 768w, https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CanaryDressnewHIGH2-645x1024.jpg 645w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Check out the full collection on www.sikadesigns.co.uk The post You Need these Ghanaian-made Batik Dresses in your Wardrobe STAT appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
