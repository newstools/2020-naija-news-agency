Matteo Guendouzi appeared to be booked for sarcasm in a vintage Mike Dean moment in Arsenalâ€™s clash against Portsmouth in the FA Cup fifth round. The Frenchman has been out of favour in recent weeks after a reported incident of indiscipline during the winter break. He was recalled to the side for the tie at Fratton Park as Arteta made nine changes to the team that lost 2-1 in the Europa League to Olympiacos. With 35 minutes on the clock, the 20-year-old was shown a yellow card by Mike Dean in bizarre circumstances. Dean brought play back as Arsenal had taken a free-kick too quickly in the centre circle. And Guendouzi sarcastically slammed the ball down on the ground, in a moment of petulance that was punished by Dean, who has a reputation for being one of footballâ€™s more theatrical officials. It was wonderful. A yellow card for sarcasm? <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f914.png?ssl=1" alt="ðŸ¤”" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Mike Dean appears to caution Matteo Guendouzi for placing the ball down in an exaggerated way. pic.twitter.com/Xf3NFHUmsS â€” Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) March 2, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The post Arsenal star booked for sarcasm as he out-Deans Dean appeared first on Football365.
