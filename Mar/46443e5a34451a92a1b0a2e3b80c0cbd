The suspension of consultation services to regular outpatients was announced by the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the hospital, Jesse Otegbayo, on Wednesday. According to reports from Guardian, Otegbayo said other departments in the hospital will also stop rendering services till further notice. The units affected are outpatients clinics, medicine, and surgery, and pediatric departments. Otegbayo said the action became necessary due to the accidental exposure of some doctors in the institution to some suspected Covid-19 patients. He said that the suspension was to curtail the spread of the deadly disease. With the suspension of these services, this implies that scores of people who regularly access medical treatment from the institution will no longer have access to it until further notice. This will affect not just the state or South-western Nigeria, but patients from all over the country.
