After getting lightly dolled up, she officially began her reporting duties with a series of heartwarming, vlog-style interviews, where she caught up with celebrities and award nominees like Toni Tones, Swanky JKA, and Dakore Egbuson as they glammed up for the red carpet. Following this, she took a break so as to get ready for the red carpet herself. Dressed in a barely sweeping, off-shoulder red dress designed by Bandela, and even more stunning make-up, she spent the red carpet session speaking with and to guests, nominees and top industry players in the ranks of Timini Egbuson, Kemi Adetiba, Toyin Abraham and Blossom Chukwujeku. The fan reporter spent the rest of the night networking and enjoying what was nothing short of an iconic award night. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1394890" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/am2-scaled.jpg?resize=1709%2C2560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1709" height="2560" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Talking about the experience, Bamishe who is a final year student of Covenant University and an aspiring OAP with Hebron F.M, considered it an opportunity to live out one of her wildest dreams which was precisely what she needed to give her career a boost. “I never imagined that I would be interviewing some of my favorite T.V stars,” she said. “I feel very lucky and excited to have been chosen.
