Sweet like water wey dey inside coconut,
Sip after Sip you give me stamina
Wait for you so the same time we cummot,
Me and you na the same time
I never want to leave omo,
So dance with me omo
I pull up on your beach omo,
It’s time to swim omo [Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl make you no dey lie
Make you tell your friends say you dey feel dis guy
Don’t even waste time
Cos na me you go follow till the day we die
But meanwhile, I can’t wait to make your face just smile
It’s not a lie, you set my soul on fire [Chorus]
So many girls have passed through,
None of the girls fine pass you
So many things you’ve been through
Promise life will never be the same again oh
Wouldn’t be the same again,
Will never be the same again
Would never be the same again oh,
Never be the same again [Verse 2]
No mind them dem dey lie to you
Dem talk say me I’m too bad for you
No mind them dem dey lie to you
Dem talk say me I’m no good for you
Say my heart na glass omo don’t break it oh
Break it oh, take it o, take

Mun Ah Mun An take it o
Whine your waist rate it o,
Tate it baby mi rate it o, Wait It

Whine your waste, Rotate it o, Ahh [Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl make you no dey lie
Make you tell your friends say you dey feel dis guy
Don’t even waste time
Cos na me you go follow till the day we die
But meanwhile, I can’t wait to make your face just smile
It’s not a lie, you set my soul on fire [Chorus]
So many girls have passed through,
None of the girls fine pass you
So many things you’ve been through
Promise life will never be the same again oh
Wouldn’t be the same again,
Will never be the same again
Would never be the same again oh,
