Yemi despite being one of Africa’s greatest exports in terms of music, is one of the most criticized female artistes in the country. However, Yemi has never allowed the naysayers to deter her from being who she is and has continued to make a name for herself. Today, she is a year older and she took to the gram to share beautiful pictures of herself to mark the special day and also shared a beautiful message. She wrote: “Another year, God keeps showing off with me. I am grateful, I am blessed, I am favoured. #happybirthday to me.” Happy birthday Yemi Alade!
