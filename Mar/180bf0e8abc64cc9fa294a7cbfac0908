The hitmaker took to twitter on the 16th of March to rant on how his career has suffered a lack of collaboration from top artiste in recent time, artistes whom he claims only come to him when they’re in need but do not reciprocate the favour when demanded. He wrote; “You all have been asking, ‘Why is Samklef not dropping these beats, s*** like that…’ Most of these artists that you (I) knew when you (I) was way valid… I’m tired of reaching out to artists and begging for collaboration. But this year…”  I’m tired of begging for collaboration from your artist…I new most of them b4 they became stars… they only reach out when they need something from u once they get what they want they go mute. https://t.co/Y72uwUwCsU pic.twitter.com/zfRR9rV9KX — samklef the great.
