Paul Ince doesn’t think Odion Ighalo would’ve scored his brilliant goal in Manchester United’s 5-0 win over LASK in the Europa League if it had been in front of a full house. In one of a number of last-16 first legs played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, United ran out comfortable winners over the Austrian Bundesliga leaders at Linzer Stadion. United, Europa League champions in 2017, led 1-0 at half-time through a brilliant Ighalo goal before Daniel James doubled their lead just before the hour. F365 SAYS: Impressive Man Utd momentum must go to waste… Three late goals from Juan Mata, Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira sealed the win and what should be a berth in the last eight for Ole Gunnar Solksjaer’s in-form side, who have now kept nine clean sheets during an 11-game unbeaten run. However, Ince reckons Ighalo only scored his fantastic strike because it was in a match played behind closed doors.   Ince told BT Sport: “It reminds me of one of those goals you try in training. If it’s a full house, I don’t know. “Maybe I’m doing a disservice to him, but I don’t know…” Fellow pundit Owen Hargreaves interrupted and said: “Come on, Incey, that’s a beautiful goal! That’s one of the best goals he’s ever scored.” On Bruno Fernandes, who got the assist for Ighalo’s goal, Hargreaves added: He’s been magnificent. He has made everyone better. “He loves shots from outside the box, he is one of the best at it. His goals and assists are right there. “Everyone is playing better. He has given everyone a lift and he is the real deal.” The F365 Show has so far escaped the wrath of coronavirus.
