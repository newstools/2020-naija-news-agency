Fortunately, his son, David Adeleke, Jnr and the rest of his gang tested negative. Celebrities have reached out to the singer and his family and millions of fans have done the same. However, there are some social media users who believe that the singer is doing this for clout. They believe he did this to bring rave to his newly released song “Mafa Mafa”  while others are pissed that he used his influence to get he and 33 of his guys tested.

Only to come back to Lagos and be travelling everywhere. Chioma got back too and was everywhere with him.
