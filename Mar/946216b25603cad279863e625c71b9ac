<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364930" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/viet-jet-handout.jpg?resize=618%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="Airline, Coronavirus" width="618" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A Vietnamese airline seeking business during the coronavirus slowdown is offering passengers a novel perk — an insurance plan that will pay them up to $8,570 if they catch the deadly bug after flying with them. Vietjet’s “Sky Covid Care” insurance is provided free of charge for all eligible passengers regardless of their age or nationality — on all domestic flights until June 30, according to the UK’s Independent. “With the insurance, passengers are eligible for insurance coverage and benefits from Vietjet within 30 days starting at 00:01 of the flight date, regardless of how passengers are infected with the disease,” the carrier said. Vietjet said it has set aside “tens of billion dong” to cover the insurance, which is designed to “bring passengers assurance.” (At current exchange rates, 24,000 Vietnamese dong is equivalent to $1.02.) To qualify, the airline said, passengers must provide “all information in accordance with Vietjet’s terms and conditions” when buying the tickets including the full name with ID as proof, date of birth, phone number and email address. The customer also must “comply with all regulations on disease prevention and control of Vietjet, the Ministry of Health and authorities,” it added. The caveat is that people who have already been tested positive are ineligible, as are those who violate safety regulations, such as isolation or travel bans. The airline also said it won’t cover passengers with epilepsy, mental illness or suicidal behavior. As of Wednesday, Vietnam had 134 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Vietjet, which describes itself as a “new age” airline, also made headlines in 2012, when it was fined after hosting a bikini show on one of its planes, the Independent reported.
