The star-studded 17-tracker body of work has guest appearances from A- list acts such as Wizkid to 2Baba to Falz and even Teni made the cut. Others who had the privilege of a verse/hook on the amazing work were Johnny Drille, Peruzzi, Small Doctor and lots more. Sound Sultan did a madness on this album because I have heard it and strongly recommend it, even for this quarantine season. The “8th Wondah” album has 12 main tracks and 5 bonus tracks, FIVE!!!! On one of the bonus tracks, The Naija Ninja Boss threw back the hands of time with “Ghetto Love” which features Ajegunle/Street heavyweights – Marvelous Benjy, Daddy Showkey, African China, Danfo Drivers and Baba Fryo. You need to listen to that one, guys! On the release of the album, Sound Sultan says: “Thanks as you download and stream the New Album .you keep me going 20 years and countin big shout out to everyone who made it possible .thanks to my producers and mix engineers @iam_niyi_p @indomixng @teeymixofficial” Guys, “8th Wondah” Album is OUT NOW!!
