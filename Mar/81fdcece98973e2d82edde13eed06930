Elumelu made the call in Asaba, Delta State, in response to the rising cases of kidnapping and killings by herdsmen especially with the unabated attacks by herdsmen on Issele-Azagba community,  which is less than three kilometers from Asaba. He said even though the Service Chiefs are not courageous enough to listen to the voice of the people and honourably resign, they would one day give account of their stewardship and may regret their continued stay even in the face of escalating insecurity. Elumelu lamented that the country was degenerating, adding that people were suffering due to lack of tangible results in the fight against insurgency and banditry across the country. He wandered why herdsmen caught by security agencies for kidnapping, raping and killing of innocent people are not  persecuted but let off the hook thereby, emboldening them to carry out more atrocious acts. Calling on the Service Chiefs to exit honourably, the lawmaker said there were so many young officers with brighter brains who have been trained and acquainted with what it takes to fight insurgency in the country. Elumelu pointed out that despite the huge amount of funds allocated to security agencies by the Federal and State Governments, the security agencies were yet to stamp out or reduce to the barest minimum cases of kidnapping, insurgency and herdsmen attacks on innocent people across the country.
