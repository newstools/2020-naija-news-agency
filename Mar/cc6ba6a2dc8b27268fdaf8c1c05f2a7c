Bruno Fernandes says that Pep Guardiola “didn’t deserve” his respect when he shushed the Manchester City boss during Manchester United’s recent win over their arch-rivals. Fernandes had the last laugh in a heated exchange with City manager Guardiola after Man Utd beat the Citizens 2-0 in the Manchester derby. Portugal midfielder Fernandes, who set up the opening goal for Anthony Martial, put his fingers to his lips after arguing with Guardiola moments before Scott McTominay sealed victory in injury time. Fernandes told Sky Sports: “I talked about this with some friends and some people think ‘Pep won everything, who is Bruno to diss him?’ But I think it is about respect.  “Now, I think outside of the pitch I don’t do this again if I am on the pitch now. But, at that moment the words he told me made me mad, and on the pitch I am a little bit nervous, it is the kind of player I am. “I have respect for Pep and what he won, and what he did for football because he changed some mentalities in football. “But, at that moment he didn’t deserve my respect at that moment on the pitch.” The F365 Show has so far escaped the wrath of coronavirus.
