Following the confusion, the House after heated debate rejected both reports and a committee of the whole house ultimately rejected her confirmation through a voice vote, a situation for which some members condemned the presentation of two reports. Also, representative of #Bakassi, Ekpo Ekpo Bassey,cautioned the house against setting a bad precedence, saying, “This is my fifth year in the House and I have never seen two reports being presented to the House from a committee. The House has to be on the side of justice at all times and avoid setting a bad precedence. We need to strengthen institutions and avoid sowing seeds of ethnicity and disunity in the House.” Ikpeme hails from Akwa Ibom state, but she is married to an indigene of Cross River. Itam Abang, representing Boki constituency, also said it is sad that the assembly has been prejudiced by ethnic sentiments.
