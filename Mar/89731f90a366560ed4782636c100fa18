There has been a great deal of controversy over offsides in the Premier League this season, with a number of goals ruled out by very fine margins after VAR checks. “I’m certainly in favour of discussing a new way of looking at the offside rule, to see if it can help, because I think the issue is more an issue of understanding,” Infantino said as he arrived in Belfast for Saturday’s annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board, the game’s law-making body. “Some of the decisions are very, very close and it’s difficult for the people who are watching to see whether it’s offside, so we have to look at whether we can make the offside rule clearer by having light in between.” Asked whether some leeway could be introduced on VAR reviews, he said: “It doesn’t solve the issue. “Even if you put a margin of 10 centimetres and then if it’s 11, it’s still one more, if it’s 10 and a half… so it doesn’t solve it. It should be clear.” Infantino agreed when asked whether the debate about offside was one that only seemed to be happening in England. “In Italy, in Spain, in Portugal, in Germany this offside discussion is not existing on the VAR,” Infantino said. “But it’s not a problem, it’s something to look into. And maybe it shows that actually it’s more a question of the rule and the application of the rule, and application of the VAR itself.” Vanguard News The post FIFA’s Infantino backs Wenger’s call on offside rule appeared first on Vanguard News.
