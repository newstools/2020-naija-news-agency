One thing that’s being discussed is that the epic “King of Boys” got denied an award. It came as a surprise to many that Kemi Adetiba‘s “King of Boys” which starred Sola Sobowale, Toni Tones, Illbliss, Akin Lewis, Reminisce, Adesua Etomi-Wellington, and many others, got snubbed at the award event. “King of Boys” also got multiple nominations, yet won no award for its outstanding cast and crew. Here’s what people are saying: Did 'King Of Boys' or Shola Sobowale just miss out of winning an award tonight? This is robbery in public.#AMVCA7 #AMVCA2020 #AMVCA pic.twitter.com/gGHbxaMZfH — G4celebNg (@G4celebng) March 14, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Why are they intentionally ignoring Kemi Adetiba’s King of Boys?? — unripe pawpaw (@Rho_daaaa) March 14, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js I stand with Shola Sobowale as Best Actress in a Drama, Movie or TV series in the king of boys #AMVCA7 pic.twitter.com/cr8U9zCC9S — EKITIKAN (@EkitiKetekan) March 12, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Is it an industry beef against King Of Boys or what? — Olayinka 🅙 (@YinkaPost) March 14, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js They cheated on King of boys no cap 😑 — 👑شَهيد|•Y•B•N•L•| (@Remmzor_YBNL) March 14, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Sola Sobowale didn’t win for that unreal performance for King Of Boys? — Olayinka 🅙 (@YinkaPost) March 14, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Sola sobowale was robbed!
