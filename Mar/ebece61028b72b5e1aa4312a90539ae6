Ace Nigerian music artist, Bigiano, who rocked clubs and parties with his 2008/2009 chart topping song, “Shayo” has made a major comeback into the Nigerian music industry with two acclaimed songs – “Chiquito” and “Go Crazy”. The multi award winning artist describes the songs as “powerful and enchanting tunes.” Go Crazy is a party sensation while “Chiquito” is a love song dedicated to beautiful African women. Commenting on the inspiration behind “Chiquito,” the vastly travelled artist had this to say: “The inspiration behind “Chiquito” comes from the things we see around especially in Africa. I am motivated by what I see and I find out a lot of our girls think less of themselves and have no confidence in how they look or their abilities. The song adores the beauty of the African woman and celebrates her self-worth.” Now, Listen, Watch and Enjoy “Go Crazy” by Bigiano below DOWNLOAD MP3 (AUDIO) The post Bigiano – “Go Crazy” [Audio + Video] appeared first on tooXclusive.
