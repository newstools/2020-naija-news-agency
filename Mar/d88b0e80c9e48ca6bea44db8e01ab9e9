One of such survival cases is the 73-year-old mom of Iroko TV CEO, Jason Njoku. Jason Njoku took to his Twitter to share the inspiring story of how his mom, who is a health care worker in the UK with an underlying sickness, went from a critical condition to surviving coronavirus. Check out her story: My mum has been an @NHSuk healthcare worker for 25 years. 14-16th March she was ill at home with ALL the symptoms of Covid19. Mrs Njoku & I screamed at her to go to the hospital. 17th March my mum went to A&E & was hospitalised. 20-21st March were on verge lungs collapsed as she pic.twitter.com/vWkDiyciZO — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js battled with Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They prepared her for ICU & intubation (Mortality rate is 40%) We cried & we prayed through the entire weekend. 6 people on her ward died. Aged 20s, 40s, 50s and 60s. She is 73 with diabetes. @NHSuk saved her life. 🙌🏾🙌🏾 — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Even with on 15L of pure Oxygen (The highest option available) she still struggled to breath & was about to be put on a ventilator. That means the machines would take over her breathing. By God's grace on the night of Sunday 21st she started to improve. Yesterday she came home. — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js My mum has never been in the hospital more than 3 days her entire 73 years. I retired her a decade ago she still works 2-3 days a week just to keep active. The overwhelming of health systems causes the spike in deaths. Its math. My mother was part of that math. She survived. pic.twitter.com/tqlVIUuWRp — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js This is me having breakfast with my mum on the 26th of February 2020. It never occured to me that it could have been the last time I saw her. Thankfully we speak almost daily so when her condition deteriorated I could hear it in her voice. Speak to your people daily in these time pic.twitter.com/bRH2iUZKFg — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Thanking the entire @NHSuk staff for looking after my mum and bringing her home. Thanking my oldest mentor and friend Dr Taiwo Olatunji for bringing calm & confidence in our darkest days. Thanking God for giving her a second chance. The Njoku clan will make it count. 🙏🏾 pic.twitter.com/gdqBqnzntc — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js I read Chemistry at Uni, so whereas I am not an expert I know how to read scientific numbers and comfortable enough with datasets to understand the grave reality we face. I have been sounding the alarm and will continue to do so. This is the gravest threat facing humanity. — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js When I closed @irokotv offices globally without an official requirement my leadership teams in Nigeria pushed back saying it wasn't necessary. I prepared early and it still touched me directly. As I have fought mis information and lack of understanding of this pandemic it's scary — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js People I respect were not taking this seriously. Covid19 is serious. Deadly serious. Listen to @NCDCgov 1. stay home 2. wash your hands frequently (every hour)3. practice social distancing (no hugs or handshakes).God Bless you all and hope you have a fantastic week ahead🙌🏾🖖🏾😷 — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js A final note on testing. They had to test my mum x4 to get a positive. It is a real problem getting accurate results. It's not a local issue it's a global one. 🙏🏾🙌🏾 — JasonNjoku (@JasonNjoku) March 30, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Photo Credit: @Jasonnjoku The post We are So Proud of Jason Njoku’s Mom who Survived Coronavirus appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
