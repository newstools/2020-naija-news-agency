Pence said that there was little reason to believe he had been exposed to the employee, who has not been to the White House since Monday. However, he said, “Given the unique position that I have as vice president and as the leader of the White House coronavirus task force, both I and my wife will be tested for the coronavirus later this afternoon.” Meanwhile, New Jersey became the latest American state Saturday to order residents to stay at home in a bid to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Governor Phil Murphy said all gatherings were canceled and non-essential businesses “must indefinitely close their physical stores” from 9:00 PM (0100 GMT Sunday). The move follows effective lockdown orders in several US states, including California, New York and Illinois. [AFP] Vanguard News Nigeria.
