Liverpool under-23 coach Neil Critchley has been appointed the new head coach of League One side Blackpool. Critchley has taken charge of two Liverpool first-team fixtures in Jurgen Klopp’s absence this season with the club’s youngsters trusted in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. The Seasiders find themselves 13th in League One, after dismissing Simon Grayson last month, and they will be looking to build for a promotion push next season. Critchley has signed a contract at the club until the summer of 2023 and he’s excited to get going. “I am absolutely delighted to join Blackpool,” Critchley told Blackpool’s official website. “The trust and faith that has been shown in me from Simon and Ben gives me a very special feeling inside. “I can’t wait to get started, I’m really looking forward to the weeks and months ahead, meeting the players, working on the grass, developing the team and meeting some of the supporters. “The time I’ve had at Liverpool has been truly special. I’ve been incredibly well supported there from Alex Inglethorpe, the Academy Manager, and all the staff. “It’s a truly special football club and it’s the people that make the football club the place that it is. It would have had to have taken something equally as special, if not more, for me to even think about leaving. “But from the conversations I’ve had here, I got a really good feeling about the people, where they want the Club to go and how they want it to grow.” <img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f4dd.png?ssl=1" alt="📝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" />
