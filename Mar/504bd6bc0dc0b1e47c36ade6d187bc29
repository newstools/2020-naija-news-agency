Favour George, who already has three singles to her credit; “Onye”, “Blessings All Around” and her most recent titled “JESUS”, said the song “Endless Praise” was also inspired by circumstances that she and her husband went through and overcame by God’s mercies, granting her husband a double promotion at his place of work that they didn’t see coming. “God filled our mouth with endless praise and our feet with dancing”. – Favour George Get into your gratitude mood with “Endless Praise”.
