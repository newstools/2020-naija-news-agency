Zlatan Ibile & Obesere in the studio Zlatan Ibile & Obesere in the studio is a little more than coincidence. Given, that the Egungun rave is coming 19 years after the song’s release is proof of the internet’s oft understated power. But like Wale Oloworekende notes in his excellent essay, they’re contrarians, upsetting the conservative with their carefree music. Like Zlatan has been known to do, the clip of he and Obesere is hilarious and features his adlibs, as the Fuji legend worlds a happy smile on his face. If you’ve got a thing for the funny and crazy, you’ll want to see this video. And, following a trend, it definitely won’t be a surprise if Zlatan releases a song soon.
