The superstar who had to suspend his US Tour earlier this month, has been spending time with his wife & son, who recently returned from the Coronavirus-hit UK, along with other members of the DMW gang. According to Davido, of 31 people associated with him that got tested (including Mayorkun, Peruzzi, Dremo, and the rest of the DMW gang), only Chioma returned a positive result, albeit with no symptoms. In any case, all 31 of them have now gone into the precautionary 14 day isolation period. See Davido’s official announcement on his Instagram page below. Hey everyone ! I came back recently from America after cancelling tour. My fiancé Chioma also came back from London recently with our baby. We had no symptoms and still both feel perfectly fine but because of our recent travel history we decided to take ourselves and our all close associates we’ve come in recent contact with for the COVID-19 test on the 25th of March. Unfortunately, my fiancé’s results came back positive while all 31 others tested have come back negative including our baby. We are however doing perfectly fine and she is even still yet to show any symptoms whatsoever. She is now being quarantined and I have also gone into full self isolation for the minimum 14 days. I want to use this opportunity to thank you all for your endless love and prayers in advance and to urge everyone to please stay at home as we control the spread of this virus! Together we can beat this!
