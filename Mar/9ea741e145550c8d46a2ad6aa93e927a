VIDEO: Mudi – Blessings It takes you to know who Mudi is and how his passion for music grew over time before you can grab the value of this new tune. Delta state born Mudiaga Williams has been a committed singer since the age of 14 being a member of the Redeemed Christian Church teenage choir. He found the appropriate balance between his education and the music side during his undergraduate days. This made recording his 2016 first single as effortless as it could be. ‘Blessings’ as produced by Kizzybeats comes as a refined effort to make it his first official single. What it demands of us is to dedicate our listening ears and tell how much of a good sound it is. Enjoy!
