More states have joined Lagos and Kwara states in sending civil servants on compulsory holidays to reduce social contact and prevent the escalation of cases. Public and private firms are adopting the work from home method, public gatherings are being prohibited, and even curfews have been placed in some states. Niger State Goes on Total Lockdown Niger State is the first state to adopt one of the strictest measures in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state. Even though the state has not reported any infection at the moment, the state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, declared a curfew following the coronavirus outbreak in the country. According to the governor, the curfew will begin at 8pm and end 8am until further notice, starting from Wednesday. There is also a ban on all public gatherings of more than 20 people. Street hawking and begging have also been prohibited. Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State also directed all civil servants from level 1-12 to stay at home except those on essential services.

The announcement was made by Governor Godwin Obaseki during a briefing after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the state on Monday. The first case of coronavirus in the state was confirmed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Twitter. Also, schools are to remain closed in the state and civil servants from grade level 1- 12 are to work from home among other measures to deal with COVID-19 threat in the state. <img class="size-full wp-image-1149641 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Governor-Nyesom-Wike.jpg?resize=720%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="478" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Rivers State shuts down night clubs, bans public burials, weddings and all forms of public gatherings Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has announced the shutting down of all public parks, night clubs and cinemas in the state as a result of coronavirus. He announced the establishment of surveillance posts for all the borders in Rivers, including the ports, to test people for coronavirus before they are allowed entry into the state. Governor Wike, revealed that the new policy takes effect this Tuesday. Wike also banned all forms of open worship, public weddings and burials. In a speech posted on his Facebook, Wike said: With effect from the same date (Tuesday, March 24, 2020), all public parks, night clubs and cinemas in the State are to remain closed till further notice. Similarly, after due consultations with religious leaders, it was agreed that all religious organisations are to temporarily stop all forms of open worship. Public burial and wedding ceremonies are also banned within this period. In view of the fact that the disease spreads fast through body contact, social distance has become imperative if we are to contain the spread. May I, therefore call on all religious leaders, traditional rulers and opinion leaders in the State to assist government to implement these decisions by ensuring that persons under their care do not fall foul of this directive. Wike directed Local Government Council Chairmen to ensure that public burials and weddings do not take place in their respective areas. May I emphasise that Local Government Chairmen are to be held responsible if public burials and weddings take place in their Local Government Areas. Government will set up monitoring teams for the 23 Local Government Areas to ensure compliance. Defaulters will be seen as enemies of the State and will be made to face appropriate sanctions. My Dear Good People of Rivers State, the essence of governance is to protect lives and we cannot be indifferent when this COVID-19 continues to claim lives world-wide. We urge everyone to remain calm and maintain social distance. We shall continue to review the situation and adjust accordingly. Like I said in my Broadcast last Friday, these decisions may seem painful for all of us but there is no price that is too much to pay for us to stay alive. The Rivers State Governor stated that with effect from Tuesday, March 24, 2020, surveillance posts would be set up across the state. The Rivers State Government has reviewed current developments across the country is desirous to further strengthen prevention measures across the State to keep our citizens safe. To this end, with effect from tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24, 2020, Surveillance Posts are to be set up at the following Borders of the State:
(1) Emohua for motorists coming from Bayelsa and States
(2) Omerelu for motorists coming from Owerri
(3) Okehi for motorists coming from Imo State through Etche

(6)Opoku in Khana Local Government Area for motorists coming from Akwa Ibom State. Marine entry points: Port Harcourt and Onne Ports , Nembe, Bille,Bonny and NLNG Jetties are also going to be under surveillance. Each of the Surveillance Posts shall be manned by trained health and security personnel who will ensure that motorists and seafarers are tested before they are allowed to enter the State. All motorists and seafarers are please enjoined to cooperate with the Surveillance teams as they have been empowered to legitimately enforce this directive. I use this medium to call on citizens to minimise family visits. Rather , everyone should maintain contacts through the use of telephones. Pic.36.
