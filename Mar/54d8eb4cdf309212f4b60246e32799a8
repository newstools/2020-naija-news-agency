Spanish newspaper Marca claim Jurgen Klopp ‘belittled’ Diego Simeone ahead of Liverpool’s shock Champions League defeat to Atletico Madrid. The Reds boss admitted he was a “bad loser” after complaining about Simeone’s tactics at Anfield, as Atletico overcame Liverpool 3-2, 4-2 on aggregate. The comments flew under the radar initially in Spain, with the press focussing on another excellent victory for Atletico. But Marca changed tack on Friday, with a piece looking into how Simeone added Klopp to a list of great managers he has got the better of, according to Sport Witness. They pointed to Klopp’s joke when the draw was made: “I don’t think Simeone is running around his living room happily.” OPINION: We love Klopp but ‘proper football’? Proper nonsense And claimed that this comment came back to bite him. Apparently, the ‘triumphal’ Liverpool manager did ‘not contemplate’ just how difficult it would be to overcome Simeone and Atletico, who have done it before ‘against opponents with better players’. Klopp therefore ‘belittled’ Simeone, to his and Liverpool’s cost.  The F365 Show has so far escaped the wrath of coronavirus.
