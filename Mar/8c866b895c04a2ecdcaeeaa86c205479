Virgil van Dijk has promised that Liverpool “are still bringing the title to our fans” despite the suspension of the Premier League suspension. The Premier League has been temporarily stopped until early April as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic. There is uncertainty as to how and when the authorities will proceed with the campaign, or even whether they will at all. While some are championing the idea of cancelling the campaign in its entirety and voiding the expected Liverpool title win, Van Dijk has promised that a first top-flight championship since 1990 will be delivered one way or another. The Dutchman hopes to avoid the ‘fear’ of many at the club ‘fear’ – that it will be lifted inside an empty stadium with fans prevented from watching due to the coronavirus. “If we won it in an empty stadium and the fans weren’t there, I’d be gutted for them. “Obviously, if there are no fans at Anfield, then it will be a bit of a blow – no one wants to play games without the fans. “Until a decision is made on how we go on from here, then we just have to deal with it. But when it happens, we are still bringing the title to our fans, definitely.” The post Van Dijk makes massive pledge to ‘gutted’ Liverpool fans appeared first on Football365.
