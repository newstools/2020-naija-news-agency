Thanks for your mails. Send more to theeditor@football365.com  Distilling Jose…
I had thought Mourinho’s comment about the fans not knowing what Parrott looked like was too snide not to be pointed at the weekend. Jose Mourinho deciding that circumstances have aligned to ensure that the section of the fans sitting directly behind him are not actually real fans and are, in fact, outsiders unrepresentative of the truth or the general mood of the club, and therefore being out to get him, has to be one of the most Mourinho-ish things Mourinho has ever said. Essence of José, if you will. I’m watching the new season of Better Call Saul this week and the writers always find a way for him to find an excuse that almost sounds reasonable in order to justify even the most blameworthy of failings on his part. Sounds a lot like someone else who’s back after an absence…
Jamie  Are you happy with Jose?
Genuine question for Spurs fans of the mailbox, after exiting the FA Cup last night, the likelihood of doing so in the UCL also and the overall results since the Mourinho ‘manager bounce’ came to an end, are you genuinely happy with having Jose Mourinho as your head coach over Mauricio Pochettino or would you take him back in a heart beat? I know it seemed Spurs we’re struggling under him, you’ve also lost Son and Kane to injuries, but it doesn’t seem the experiment so far is working out, this is no gloating mail at all as I genuinely like many other fans love Poch and was sad to see him sacked.
Mikey, CFC  Well…
Generally speaking, I have been supportive of what Daniel Levy has done at Spurs, built a club that is financially sustainable, great ground, training facilities and all that – he is clearly a talented businessman. He does though have a rather poor recruitment record. Levy has had, including caretakers, over a dozen managers in his time as Chairman of THFC, in my eyes, only three have been successful, Jol, Harry and of course Pochettino. We could argue that Harry and Mourinho were both hired the same way, a manager fired and miraculously a replacement can come in the next day, so this recruitment technique seems to suggest a 50:50 success rate (yes, am already saying that Mourinho is a wrong-un, but I am guilty of holding that view from day 1, too similar to the George Graham scenario for my taste). But interestingly, the other two successful managers were hired following a failure to secure or hold on to his first choice – Jacques Santini’s sudden departure enabled his number 2, Martin Jol, to take over. Pochettino only got the job because Louis Van Gaal did an about face and decided that Manchester United was a better option. So all in all, Levy has fluked his successful managers and failed manfully with the likes of Tim Sherwood, Juande Ramos, Villas-Boas and now, the cherry on top Mourinho. Already Mourinho has reverted to type, blamed everyone else and taken all the joy out of watching Spurs – hope Levy is smart enough to have built an exit clause into Mourinho’s contract. Alternatively, this could just be a huge ploy to help Amazon with the next series of All or Nothing…..here’s hoping.
Rob (COYS)  30 years and then…
I waited 30 years to have sex. I have waited 30 years to win the Premier League. To all the commentators and rival fans who are concerned for my upcoming lack of enjoyment at seeing Liverpool win the league, I will be enjoying that as much as the aforementioned. Thanks for your concern however.
Dave LFC  Don’t look back in anger
Do you remember when I wrote in, describing Young Jurgen as an “arrogant egotist” for throwing the domestic cups away, with abandon? Do you remember that I stated that Young Jurgen was denying the Liverpool fans the chance of a trip to Wembley because he thinks that the FA Cup and the League Cup, were beneath him? Do you remember the opprobrium that was heaped on me as the Liverpool fans didn’t bother to actually read my mail, they just leaped to defend their leader against a mail that was actually on ‘their’ side? Well, I remember it quite well as I read the unhappy Liverpool emails bemoaning this state of affairs with our domestic cups. I knew they’d come round… eventually. The thing is, Klopp DOES have this wrong. He’s denying the chance for his players to lift a famous old trophy or two, in one of the world’s most famous stadiums. He’s denying the Liverpool fans the chance to have a proper day out. To indulge themselves by opening their first beers of the day at an ungodly hour and laughing about it. Pep has this right. It IS a winning habit to engender and nobody can tell me that the City players didn’t want to climb those stairs to lift the League Cup. You may say “pfft, it’s only the League Cup” and you’d be right. However, it’s another trophy on your clubs Roll of Honour and another trophy in the cabinet. As far as I can see, there are few players that don’t want another winners medal to display amongst their other mementos. Liverpool are 99.99% likely to win the Premier League (personally, I conceded it to my scouse brother in law in early December) and so far, it’s been a great season for the club, players, fans and manager, absolutely no doubt about that. I doff my cap and I only hope that some of our records remain unbroken at the end of this season. However, last season, we were the first English team *ever* to have a clean sweep of domestic trophies. It’s never been done before and we have gone down in the history books as unique. That’s because City want to win every trophy that we can and I love that. I just don’t understand why Young Jurgen doesn’t want liverpool fans to enjoy that feeling though. Many will point to the deserved Champions League success and snigger that someone has written in to this mailbox championing the FA Cup and League Cup when Liverpool are European champions (I’m not going to talk about that ridiculous “world” champions trophy, I have an itchy big toe that’s more important than that). Well, Liverpool fans, think back to your treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup. Were you not bothered about winning those trophies? The sniffy Mr Klopp does have a case to answer for and you Liverpool fans should be demanding answers. All the best
Levenshulme Blue, Manchester 19 (Just trying to help, as ever)  Relax, Liverpool fans
Liverpool are not wobbling, they are not falling apart, they have not been found out. Atletico was a fluke, we played an overly defensive side away at home in Europe and they scored a flukey goal. Watford we got pummeled, we thought we could go walk against a team who is fighting for their lives with a good manager and we got our a$$es handed to us but we got what we deserved. Against Chelsea we made SEVEN CHANGES in a competition the manager has made clear he doesn’t care about. He also fielded a midfield of Fabinho, Lallana and Curtis Jones who have never played a football match together. People need to relax and gain some perspective.
Todd, Boston  …For goodness sake calm down before deciding Liverpool are finished. I’m sure the Sky Empire will label them a ‘crisis club’ before the end of the week. Generates clicks innit. So. Lost to Madrid. In Madrid. That never happens. Can’t believe they didn’t with 9-0, just like *everyone* else does. Went a goal behind early. Struggled to get back on terms. Again. Totally unheard of against a Simeone side. A side that almost every half decent journalist/commentator said was the side most like their own and so not one they wanted to play yet. Other terrible sides to lose Champions League knock out stage games in that stadium since 2013/14 include : Bayern, Barca, Real and Juve. FYI : From what I can find online they’ve lost one game at home in a knockout of any European competition this millennium. That was against Rubin Kazan. Got bullied by Watford strikers and lost that game. Yep. Bit of an odd result. Not the result (you only needed to see the return fixture to realise Watford weren’t mugs that day either) but the scoreline. Then you think…Troy vs Dejan. With the former right up for it. Could be interesting. Lost away at Chelsea. First goal to a keeping error. Major changes to first-choice team. Yep. Sure they’d like to stay in the cup but just to be clear…what narrative were we aligned to a few weeks back, was it that Liverpool disrespected the Cup in the last round with the team of teenagers or that they’ve been desperate to win it and so Chelsea will be lorded as super brilliant and next years league winners ? Also, lets be fair to Chelsea – they’ve been cracking and confusing at times this year. The former is a very capable side. What we’ve seen is that individual mistakes hurt teams and that good sides always have a chance. Welcome to…well….Arsenal / Man Utd / Man City / Tottenham defending for most of this season at least. Oh and that keeper we’re all trying to strike from our minds at West Ham. You know that one. So. Dunk the biscuit. Drink the tea. Remember that stuff happens. Weird stuff. I mean. Mascherano and Tevez once signed for West Ham. At the same time. Yes, they’re still a very good side. Yes, they might only win the league (maybe the fastest it has ever been won btw). Yes, next season will be different – the clue is in the ‘next’ bit. Yes, they’ll need to improve that side – but we’re all expecting City to spend (and if no Euro Competition for a few years to have fresher players and maybe concentrate their money into quality rather than squad) and for Utd to develop and then what will Chelsea / Everton get up to etc. Then remember that narrative sells newspapers and drives clicks.
Matt    Dear Liverpool fans…crow away
I am genuinely relieved that your team can’t match the achievement of my (Invincible) team 16 years ago. I am also glad you’re out of the FA cup because that trophy is rightly Arsenal’s. That’s our competition. Now you may notice in the above paragraph that I boast proudly of 2 achievements: going a league season without losing, and winning the cup more than any other team. Both of those records are somewhat tainted. The Invincibles for example should have won the Champions League. Arsenal never have. And some of our FA Cup wins were hardly the result of unstoppable form (see rescuing the 2014 final from 2-0 down, after Mertesacker rescued a 1-1 draw against Wigan). However these caveats do not ever diminish the joy of the trophy, or the bragging rights that come with. So come the end of the season your team will be champions. You might not have done it unbeaten, and you may have won any other trophy (still time for a famous European Night at Anfield©) but champions you will be. Experience tells me that it will not take away from the fun. Also, the only fans that think you’re unbearable are Everton and Man U fans. So please, brag and brag loudly.
Mike, Arsenal, Leeds  Liverpool fans making everyone happy
When Steven Gerrard retired, I remember thinking that he had a career that made all football fans happy. Liverpool fans, naturally, because of all of his amazing achievements and trophies won, but also opposition fans too, for moments like the (rolleyes) slip, red cards, with a couple of own goals and errant backpasses leading to goals thrown in too (not forgetting that time Everton fans celebrated him getting substituted). Who hasn’t at some point enjoyed watching Steven Gerrard? With Liverpool losing to Watford and Chelsea, I thought along the same lines except with everyone effectively being happy with Liverpool winning the league. Dave Tickner’s article seemed to sum it up pretty well. Arsenal are happy that they aren’t Invincible. Man U fans happy there’s no Treble, everyone else happy enough that they have had the time to come to terms with not being able to use all those memes about Liverpool having never won the Premier League anymore. What a lovely end to the season we can all have! <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png?ssl=1" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Don L. Renegade  Bruno? Who knows?
Everyone seems to be forgetting that plenty of players have popped up at United and absolutely blown everyone away for their first few games. Veron was stonking for about 6 games. More recently Pogba, Di Maria Mkhitaryan and Falcao all started pretty well. Let’s just hold our horses in crowning Bruno king of the league until he has done it over a few months or a season.
Alex, Ayr  Glasgow pride in Gilmour
Can i just say how gutted I was when Billy Gilmour left my team Rangers after being with us since 5. It was well known in Glasgow what an immense potential talent he was. Sadly the then manager Mark (spread sheet) Warbuton couldn’t talk him into signing. Perhaps if Steven Gerrard had been at the club at that point he may have hung around. But some of the biggest clubs in Europe were after the boy and I imagine the contract offers were beyond anything Rangers could match. But fair play to the young lad for having the guts at such an early age to go to London and feel he could make it at Chelsea. Whilst one swallow doth not a summer make, I had immense pride watching him in the Liverpool game. I’m sure he will go from strength to strength and hopefully be a star for the Scotland team for years to come!
Neil, Glasgow  Old man, look at my life…
Stu, London, asked a question yesterday, which I was surprised didn’t get more of a response about ‘closet-traditionalism”‘ I’m a self-confessed wishy-washy-liberal of a sprightly 37-and-three-quarters, but I’ve definitely got some gammon-y views on the beautiful game, which I do my best to conceal for fear that it’ll out me as a bit of an old fogey. So if we’re having a group therapy session to let these out into the world, please see my confessional below. * Football boots. Give me a pair of Adidas World Cup or Puma Kings over any of the new-fangled, multi-coloured nonsense. I know there have been a whole raft of different colours for well over 20 years, but it still looks wrong to me. It just does. In my formative years in the Isle of Wight mens’ Saturday league between 1998 and 2004, anyone wearing ‘snazzy’ boots was definitely getting kicked into the stands by the big lump at centre half. And by “stands”, I obviously mean the hedgerow surrounding whichever sh*t-covered, waterlogged recreation ground we were hoofing a ball around that week. * Premeditated goal-celebration dances. No one will ever surpass Roger Milla, so just please stop trying. You’re embarrassing yourselves. Even you, Crouchy. * Over-intellectualising of tactics. I’m into some real Merse-Redknapp-PFM territory here and I get that a poorly-drilled team is likely to come a-cropper. I’ve even read “Inverting the pyramid” for extra hipster points so I appreciate, at the top level, it can make a difference if the players have some idea of what they’re supposed to be doing. But it is ultimately a game of chaos; and a game that is generally so low scoring, it is usually defined and determined by a moment of madness, comedy or magic. So, frankly, I don’t need to hear from the bores down the pub about ‘low blocks’, ‘false seven-and-a-halves’ and ‘double-pivots’. * Thursday and Friday night football. Part of the joy of the weekend is the anticipation built up by a couple of days without football. There’s just a bit of a sense of over-saturation now when you can watch a game pretty much every night. * I sometimes refer to the league divisions as Division 1, 2, 3 and 4 just to be contrarian, even though I only started following the game two or three years before the creation of the Premier League. * On the subject of numbers: Squad numbers. Couldn’t we just go back to 1-11?? And I hate it when you see a number 10 at centre-half or similar ridiculousness. * VAR, obviously. A blight on the game. * Twitter. A blight on society. That was quite cathartic.
