Manchester United legends Roy Keane and Gary Neville set targets for their former side ahead of a crucial Manchester derby on Sunday. The Red Devils are under even more pressure after Chelsea spanked Everon 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in the earlier in the day. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have already got the better of their Manchester rivas twice this season, and Keane claims they must win again if they are to remain in the hunt for Champions League qualification. He told Sky Sports: “Without a doubt it’s a more important game for United. It was a poor second half performance last week against Everton. “Draws are no good for United now, they have to win games like this.” With City looking well placed to finish second, Neville agrees with his ex-teammate that the fixture is more important for the red half of Manchester. He explaine: “I think so. They are a bit more consistent and there is a bit of a good feeling. It has given them more arrogance. “This is a different test for them today. When United have had a chance to go close to that fourth place, they falter. “United have a massive chance. If they can get three or four points from these two matches against City and Tottenham , they have a great set of fixtures afterwards.”  For some bizarre reason, the F365 Show still hasn’t been cancelled.
