Champion Make haffi mantra as e go
Bounce to the sound while I bounce with the doe
Serve yourself na the matter with the do
Omo you dey slow, move make a move
I go slide then you go sink like boat
Me I just dey laugh that the life is a joke
And the Igbo girls wey dey clean, wey dey cook
If your boyfriend no get money then they can’t cope (kuro n’be) When I reach Igbo land them calling me Odogwu (Odogwu)
And as I enter the town I put am for agu (Odogwu)
And nobody can stop you, na so we dey fly pass oh
Over any obstacle calling me Odogwu (Odogwu) Oh my God
What a symphony
Ahan
So tell me
What has gotten into me?
I step in real ride
Pull up in a Bentley
And with the
The diamond shinning on every ring you see
Lights on
Lights on

The girls dem
Dem want to touch pon my kponornor
And if you nor get work you be jantara
Abegi
So make you go sit down for one corner
You con dey border me
I go need my apology
You know I wanna see
All the fine girls wey dey totori
Make I kolobi
Hmmm When I reach Igbo land them calling me Odogwu (Odogwu)
And as I enter the town I put am for agu (Odogwu)
And nobody can stop you, na so we dey fly pass oh
Over any obstacle e be Odogwu (Odogwu) Say na who they draw the map e ooo (Odogwu)
You are looking at the champion (Odogwu)
Where they girls dey shaky nyansh e ooo (Odogwu)
Wey the person, wey the cash e ooo (Odogwu) Aje aje kekele (Odogwu)
Aje aje kekele (Odogwu)
Aje aje kekele (Odogwu)
