Frank Lampard has this evening provided his full backing to Callum Hudson-Odoi, after the gifted youngster was omitted from his matchday squad to take on Spurs over the weekend. The Blues of course welcomed Jose Mourinho’s Lilywhites to Stamford Bridge on Sunday, for a London derby showdown. The two sides headed into proceedings brimming with confidence, amid fine respective spells of form. In fact, ahead of kick-off in the capital, both Chelsea and Tottenham were aware that a positive result (or even a draw in the case of the latter) would guide them to the summit of the Premier League table. When all was said and done a little over 48 hours ago, though, the London rivals couldn’t be separated. A hard-fought affair, during which hosts Chelsea had the better of the chances, eventually played out into a 0-0 stalemate. <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeG1dmEZ8hc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe> Evidently, based on the eventual scoreline, Chelsea’s rake of attacking stars struggled to reproduce their brilliant recent best versus Spurs. Whilst the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic were all at least handed the chance to impress, however, one of the Blues’ wide-men was not even afforded a place on the club’s bench on Sunday. The player in question was Callum Hudson-Odoi, who’s absence came as something of a surprise, on the back of some superb recent performances. An official explanation for the English international’s matchday omission had since not actually been forthcoming, leading some to question whether CHO may simply have fallen back down the pecking order of Frank Lampard. Speaking during a press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League meeting with Sevilla on Wednesday, though, the Pensioners boss was keen to clarify the situation: ‘It was difficult. I have been pleased about his training recently. His attitude in training at the minute is bang on,’ Lampard explained. ‘That work ethic in training is effective in him scoring against Rennes and playing well, coming on against Newcastle and he was bright after going away with the Under-21s and doing well.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228726619-1024x581.jpg" alt="Chelsea boss Lampard explains Callum Hudson-Odoi’s weekend absence vs Tottenham"/> Chelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi scores his side’s second goal of the game during the Premier League match at The Hawthorns, West Bromwich.

I have tough decisions when I have a fully-fit squad, as we pretty much do now, to leave out players that work hard through the week and are desperate to play for the club.’ ‘I did speak to him personally. I want him to understand where he is at the minute, which is in a progression that’s getting better. There will be times where others players have to sit out and that’s a conversation we have to have with other players.’ ‘He is in contention for tomorrow and I want to see more of the same and keep that progression going. Like I say, if there are times where he is out of the squad, I want him to stay positive. That’s part of my job as well to have that communication level.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
