Word stemming from the English media on Friday suggests that Chelsea boss Frank Lampard’s insistence on securing a deal for Declan Rice could be aided by another of his side’s recent arrivals. Ongoings at Stamford Bridge of course proved one of the talking points of European football this past summer. This came with the Blues having taken advantage of the financial difficulties facing clubs across the continent, to embark on a remarkable recruitment drive. On the back of a pair of transfer windows without a single signing, Chelsea went on to secure 7 high-profile additions. After clinching deals for both Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner before the summer window had even opened, the last week of August saw all of Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva follow suit. The Londoners’ biggest outlay came in the form of a rumoured £70 million deal for German international Kai Havertz, before shot-stopper Edouard Mendy rounded out the latest batch of arrivals in southwest London. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg" alt="How Ben Chilwell’s form could aid Frank Lampard in Chelsea push for Declan Rice"/> Chelsea’s French goalkeeper Edouard Mendy plays during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on October 24, 2020.

On the back of an altogether disappointing opening to the campaign, Chelsea’s form has picked up in a major way of late, in no small part thanks to the contributions of the club’s summer additions. The likes of Hakim Ziyech, Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell have all proven integral to a 12-game unbeaten streak across all competitions. Nevertheless, though, if the latest speculation doing the rounds in the media on Friday is to be believed, then Frank Lampard does not appear ready to rest on his laurels. In fact, the Chelsea boss is already eyeing up his side’s next potential reinforcement. The player in question? Declan Rice. West Ham United star Rice was of course also linked with a move to Stamford Bridge during the summer, but the Hammers stood firm in their demands for the ever-improving English international. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273521897.jpg" alt="How Ben Chilwell’s form could aid Frank Lampard in Chelsea push for Declan Rice"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Declan Rice of West Ham United warms up prior to the Premier League match between Arsenal and West Ham United at Emirates Stadium on September 19, 2020 in London, England.

And, interestingly, it is added that the early form of one of Chelsea’s recent signings – in the form of Ben Chilwell – could prove key to Lampard’s hopes of landing the West Ham man. Law explains that despite other, cheaper left-back options being recommended by the club’s board during the summer, the Blues boss remained adamant that Chilwell, despite his £50 million+ price-tag, would prove himself to be the right addition to his side’s backline. The early evidence, meanwhile, certainly appears to back Lampard, with Chilwell having even bagged a Premier League Player of the Month nomination earlier today, on the back of a stellar November with the Blues: Ben Chilwell Bruno Fernandes Jack Grealish Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Angelo Ogbonna James Ward-Prowse Who is your @EASPORTSFIFA Player of the Month for November? https://t.co/QoNgTlc1U0 | #PLAwards pic.twitter.com/cyXBnd2KL3 — Premier League (@premierleague) December 4, 2020 In turn, it is suggested that: ‘Should Chilwell continue his excellent form, then Lampard will be in a much stronger position to urge the Chelsea board to spend big on Rice.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
