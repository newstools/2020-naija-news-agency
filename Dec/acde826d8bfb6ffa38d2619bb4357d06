Diego Simeone’s side were unable to hold onto their one-goal lead and secure qualification to the knockout stages of the Champions League knockout phases. The side will now face Red Bull Salzburg in Austria for a straight shootout for who will get the second spot. However, the Argentine coach will need to reconfigure his defence for the trip to Salzburg after it has been confirmed by Spanish media that the Uruguayan defender Jose Maria Gimenez ha sustained a significant injury. Replaced in the match by the experienced Brazilian defender Felipe, Gimenez was seen clutching his thigh. Upon returning to Madrid, the defender underwent tests and it has been confirmed that he will not play again this calendar year. Simeone does have several options. Felipe who was brought in against Bayern for Gimenez could play but Stefan Savic or Mario Hermoso for a more mobile option. With Salzburg in such good form with 11 goals in their last two games, Simeone’s defensive might will be surely tested. Meanwhile, Chelsea may now need to look elsewhere in January after being linked with the Uruguayan in the winter window. Diego Simeone spoke after the game and rued the chances which his side missed as they were hit late on by a Thomas Muller penalty. “We are not being forceful enough in attack, but we do create chances,” Simeone said. “Now we have a very tough game against Salzburg. “A small scoreline means you can always be caught. But until the penalty, Bayern had no chances to score.” Joao Felix was the sole scorer and the Portugal international has enjoyed a great start to the season. Signing for a record fee with the money made from Antoine Griezmann’s sale. His first year was not prolific but with 8 goals and 3 assists from 14 showing this campaign, things are certainly looking up. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1189572202-1024x682.jpg" alt="Chelsea target Jose Gimenez out for the year after injured for Atletico Madrid in Champions League"/> GRANADA, SPAIN – NOVEMBER 23: Joao Felix of Club Atletico de Madrid looks on prior to the start the La Liga match between Granada CF and Club Atletico de Madrid at on November 23, 2019 in Granada, Spain.

Luis is missing through coronavirus, Diego is in his recovery phase and will be out for longer,” he said speaking after his goal was not enough to give the Rojiblancos the win. “The work we are doing is good, but we have to work harder on finishing situations. We are working on that in training.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
