Confirmation of a horrific accident, resulting in the tragic passing of a member of FC Lorient’s ground staff, has emerged online this evening. Lorient took to the pitch earlier today, for their latest Ligue 1 outing. Les Merlus welcomed Stade Rennais to the Stade du Moustoir, in the hopes of putting their early season struggles behind them. When all was said and done, however, the exact opposite unfolded, as Christophe Pélissier’s men were condemned to a 3-0 defeat. Their latest result leaves Lorient sitting 19th in the French top-flight, with just 11 points from 16 outings. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230235202-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tragedy strikes in France as Lorient groundsman dies after being struck by falling floodlight following Rennes clash"/> Rennes’ French midfielder Benjamin Bourigeaud (R) celebrates after scoring during the French L1 football match between FC Lorient and Stade Rennais at the Moustoir Stadium in Lorient, western France, on December 20, 2020.

This comes on the back of a tragic accident in the aftermath of the clash, which eventually cost one individual his life. As revealed by GFFN, amongst others, as the Lorient ground staff took to the Stade du Moustoir pitch following the full-time whistle, a section of floodlights in the ground fell from above. One of those tending to the grass was struck by the structure, leaving him requiring immediate medical treatment.

It has since been announced, however, that the injuries sustained proved too severe, with the Merlus member of staff, in turn, having sadly passed away. We are devastated to report that this individual has now passed away from his injuries.
