Chelsea saw a 14-game unbeaten streak across all competitions come to an end at Everton this evening, with the Blues’ struggles in the attacking third having proven the key takeaway. Frank Lampard’s men made the trip to Goodison Park a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. The visitors headed into proceedings amid a scintillating spell of recent form, which had seen them remain unbeaten across all competitions since late September. In turn, Chelsea were no doubt fully aware ahead of kick-off that another victory this evening would guide them, at least temporarily, beyond both Liverpool and Tottenham to the summit of the English top-flight table. When all was said and done on Merseyside, however, the in-form Blues finally came unstuck. An all-round disappointing display on the part of Lampard’s outfit saw a solitary Gylfi Sigurdsson strike eventually prove enough to guide Everton to all 3 points. The only goal of the evening came just past the 20-minute mark, when, after Edouard Mendy needlessly felled Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the away side’s box, Sigurdsson stepped up to slot away the ensuing spot-kick in confident fashion. Not one of Edouard Mendy’s greatest moments in a Chelsea shirt…  pic.twitter.com/YtUO8DPFqY — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 12, 2020 Chelsea, in their defence, were unlucky to strike the woodwork on a pair of occasions, first through Reece James, and later courtesy of a bending Mason Mount free-kick. However, in truth, the Pensioners simply failed to perform at anywhere close to the level witnessed over recent weeks, with a stout Everton worthy of a hard-fought, much-needed win. Whilst, when all was said and done at Goodison Park, it proved tough to pin Chelsea’s defeat on one solitary aspect of their latest display, one glaring issue did come in the form of a lack of cutting edge. Upon the visitors’ starting XI surfacing this evening, the extent of their personnel woes out wide quickly became clear. Alongside the expected absences of Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi, Christian Pulisic was also not deemed fit enough to play any part versus Everton: Lampard on Pulisic: “Christian has a bit of awareness in his hamstring.He’s been training through the week but he felt some awareness and we simply can’t risk him. We have seen two wingers go down recently, Ziyech last week and Callum in training… — Simon Johnson (@SJohnsonSport) December 12, 2020 In turn, Frank Lampard was forced to make use of a wide pairing of Timo Werner – a centre-forward by trade, and Kai Havertz – an attack-minded midfielder by trade. What resulted was a disjointed attack lacking in any real flow or cohesion, as evidenced by the fact that Reece James, a right-back, proved Chelsea’s most consistent source of creativity. The only player that can really walk off that pitch at the end with their head high is Reece James. The rest, below par — CarefreeYouth (@CarefreeYouth) December 12, 2020 Whilst the personnel woes facing the Blues at present must therefore be taken into account when looking back on their performance at Goodison, what must also be faced up to is just how poor Kai Havertz looked tonight. The German international of course made the move to Stamford Bridge in a big-money deal from Bayer Leverkusen over the summer, and has since gone on to endure a largely hit-and-miss stint in southwest London. His display on Merseyside a short time ago, though, may well have come as the low point of Havertz’s Chelsea stint thus far. Yes, he is likely still building up fitness following a bout of Covid-19, and yes, he was forced to play in an unfamiliar position. But in all honesty, there isn’t really any excuse for just how disappointing the 21-year-old’s contributions proved versus Everton. Havertz appeared completely lacking in confidence, leaving passes short time and time again (and putting his teammates in danger in the process), whilst being easily brushed aside by the hosts’ more hungry midfield. Frank Lampard, amid the creative void left by Ziyech and Pulisic, really needed his star summer addition to step up to the plate this evening. Havertz, though, managed little more than the complete opposite, fading into the background, leaving his manager with no choice but to haul him off twenty minutes from time. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1175571842-1024x683.jpg" alt="Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Blues’ crisis out wide exacerbated by underperforming Havertz"/> DORTMUND, GERMANY – OCTOBER 11: Kai Havertz of Germany laughs during the Training Session And Press Conference on October 11, 2019 in Dortmund, Germany.

However, the time will soon come when he will no longer be able to lean on the ‘adaptation period’ excuse. Timo Werner, Havertz’s international teammate, was also majorly underwhelming tonight. The difference, though, is that Werner has already made crystal clear exactly what he is set to bring to Chelsea’s frontline over the months and years to come. For Havertz, on the other hand, it is simply time to step up.
