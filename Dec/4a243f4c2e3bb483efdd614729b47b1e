Struggling Chelsea wide-man Christian Pulisic has taken centre stage online on Sunday, after being forced to sit out yet another of his side’s outings. Frank Lampard’s men made the trip to Goodison Park on Saturday night, for their latest Premier League outing. The visitors headed into proceedings amid a scintillating spell of recent form, which had seen them remain unbeaten across all competitions since late September. In turn, Chelsea were no doubt fully aware ahead of kick-off that another victory would guide them, at least temporarily, beyond both Liverpool and Tottenham to the summit of the English top-flight table. When all was said and done on Merseyside, however, the in-form Blues finally came unstuck. An all-round disappointing display on the part of Lampard’s outfit saw a solitary Gylfi Sigurdsson strike eventually prove enough to guide Everton to all 3 points. The only goal of the evening came just past the 20-minute mark, when, after Edouard Mendy needlessly felled Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the away side’s box, Sigurdsson stepped up to slot away the ensuing spot-kick in confident fashion. Not one of Edouard Mendy’s greatest moments in a Chelsea shirt…  pic.twitter.com/YtUO8DPFqY — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 12, 2020 Chelsea, in their defence, were unlucky to strike the woodwork on a pair of occasions, first through Reece James, and later courtesy of a bending Mason Mount free-kick. However, in truth, the Pensioners simply failed to perform at anywhere close to the level witnessed over recent weeks, with a stout Everton worthy of a hard-fought, much-needed win. <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPsgs0W23oU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe> On the back of their defeat on Merseyside a little less than 24 hours ago, much of the post-match chatter surrounding Chelsea’s display centered on the club’s offensive struggles. Frank Lampard was unable to call on either of his first-choice wingers – Hakim Ziyech or Christian Pulisic – due to respective injuries. Ziyech’s absence, along with that of Callum Hudson-Odoi, however, was expected. That of Pulisic, on the other hand, came as a late blow, as the United States international continues to struggle in his attempts to fully recover from a hamstring problem. Speaking ahead of kick-off at Goodison Park, Lampard explained: ‘Christian has a bit of awareness in his hamstring. He’s been training through the week but he felt some awareness and we simply can’t risk him.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg" alt="Insight provided into Chelsea’s Pulisic frustration as concerning absence figures surface"/> MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY – AUGUST 03: Christian Pulisic of FC Chelsea looks on during the pre-season friendly match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and FC Chelsea at Borussia-Park on August 3, 2019 in Moenchengladbach, Germany.

Pulisic’s ability to ghost in behind, but more so than anything his willingness to beat opposing defenders in one-on-one situations, could very well have transformed Chelsea’s limp attack versus the Toffees. In turn, the emergence of the latest statistics, highlighting just how frequently the 22-year-old has been unavailable for selection since making the move to Stamford Bridge, will no doubt make for extremely concerning viewing for the Pensioners faithful. As revealed online on Sunday, Pulisic has featured from the off in just 21 of the 50 league fixtures Chelsea have played out since last summer: Christian Pulisic has started only 21 of 50 Premier League games since arriving at Chelsea because of a series of injuries. Pity, because he has often looked electric when fit. Frustrating for him. — Ian Darke (@IanDarke) December 13, 2020 And, if the latest word doing the rounds in the media this evening is to be believed, then concerns appear to be growing not only amongst fans of the London giants, but also those in a position of power at Stamford Bridge. The reliable Simon Johnson, writing for The Athletic, was quick to highlight the ‘frustration’ in Frank Lampard’s voice when discussing the latest absence of his goalscoring winger on Saturday. This comes with the Chelsea boss fully aware of the importance of natural width in his current 4-3-3 setup. The wide pairing of Timo Werner and Kai Havertz (both playing out of position) provided next to nothing when it came to chance creation versus Everton, with Lampard left to watch on, pondering what may have been, were his natural wingers available for selection. The medical staff at Stamford Bridge are said to have organised an individualised programme for Pulisic, in an attempt to strengthen key muscles in the American’s legs. The process, though, is a slow one, and could well see his manager, and teammates, continue to be frustrated by a lack of ability on the 22-year-old’s part to simply stay fit. Christian Pulisic has started only 40.8% of #CFC‘s games since joining them last year, mainly due to injury. The club are working on ways to improve his physical condition because they can ill afford for this trend to continue.
