It would be fair to say Arsenal are having a less than ideal season. Currently sitting well within the bottom half of the table, their situation has been compounded further by the words of new West Brom head coach Sam Allardyce. Allardyce took over from former boss Slaven Bilic after the Croatian was removed having overseen a series of poor results. West Brom were left dangerously close to the bottom of the table and the ownership decided to take action. Allardyce is known to be an expert in keeping clubs in the Premier League having done so with many of his former sides. Therefore, having seen plenty of clubs in and around the relegation zone, Allardyce feels that Arsenal should be considered as relegation contenders. “If they are in the bottom eight at the moment, yes. Absolutely,” he said. “Getting beaten [by Manchester City], even though it is not in the Premier League, as it would do with ours, drains the confidence of Arsenal’s players.” “They will be wondering what has hit them. They will be wondering why they are down there. They will be wondering what it takes to get out of that position. I know what it takes. I hope to convince my players to respond to that.” Arsenal face West Brom on the 2nd of January in what could be described as a relegation six pointer. Mikel Arteta addressed the media ahead of Arsenal’s League Cup quarter-final clash with Manchester City in which they lost 4-1. Arteta was asked about the prospect of relegation and spoke about the need for caution when it came to the possibility of the drop. “Well, when you are in this position and you have the points that we have at the moment, you have to look and be careful because we haven’t been a lot of times in this position,” he said. “I think last year when I came in we were in a very similar position and the same talk was around the place, it is normal because we need to start picking up points and then forget about it and start to look up the table much further. But it is a normal thing to do when you just look at the table and get the conclusions pretty quickly.” <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="Arsenal are ‘absolutely’ West Brom’s relegation rivals according to Sam Allardyce"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

Arteta was even asked about the possibility of him resigning and stepping away from the club. “At the moment, I have to try to be as positive as I can, believe in what we’re doing, try to modify things to make it work better, and stay strong. We’re going through a lot of difficulties, the last thing we want to be thinking of is more problems coming up in the next few months. I’m not in that state of mind,” the Spaniard remarked. “I know the responsibility that I have and why I am here. Everybody knows that from a few months ago, this wasn’t going to be resolved really quickly. I think that’s the consciousness of everybody at the club.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
