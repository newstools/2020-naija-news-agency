One of the weekend’s marquee Premier League ties will see Tottenham and Arsenal face off in the first north London derby of the season. The two outfits head into the highly anticipated clash in very contrasting form. Spurs will begin the weekend sitting pretty atop of the Premier League table boasting the best defence and second-best attack in the division.
