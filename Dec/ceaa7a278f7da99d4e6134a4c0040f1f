William Saliba this evening saw his first-team prospects suffer another potential blow, as Arsenal’s U21s were comfortably dispatched of by Wimbledon. Saliba’s Arsenal stint has of course proven somewhat bizarre to this point. The now-19-year-old was purchased from Saint-Etienne last summer, before being immediately loaned back to the Ligue 1 outfit, to gain further first-team experience. The general assumption, in turn, was that Saliba would return to the Emirates this summer, ahead of playing a central role in Mikel Arteta’s first-team setup – the Gunners did, after all, splash out a reported £27 million on the youngster. And Saliba has, as expected, since returned to north London. However, he is yet to secure any sort of consistent game-time. In fact, the Frenchman has not been afforded a single appearance for Arsenal’s first-team to this point. Instead, Saliba has been restricted to outings with the club’s youth sides, having surprisingly been completely omitted from Mikel Arteta’s Europa League group stage squad. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg" alt="William Saliba’s Arsenal woes continue as impressive U21s display soured by red card"/> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 13: William Saliba of Arsenal during a training session at London Colney on September 13, 2019 in St Albans, England.

Earlier this evening, Arsenal’s U21s made the trip to Plough Lane, for an EFL Trophy meeting with AFC Wimbledon. The visitors’ XI featured a number of recognisable faces, including the returning Gabriel Martinelli, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and the aforementioned Saliba. #AFCU21 TEAM NEWS @G_Martinelli01 returns from injury #EFLTrophy  pic.twitter.com/voMLdcFVLq — Arsenal Academy (@ArsenalAcademy) December 8, 2020 The experienced heads on show, however, made little difference when it came to the eventual result, as hosts Wimbledon cruised to a 3-0 victory. Compounding the woes of the Gunners, meanwhile, as outlined above, was Saliba’s dismissal. The young stopper actually excelled throughout much of the clash at Plough Lane, looking composed and intentful in possession, and full of aggression when out of it. It was precisely this aggression, however, which eventually resulted in Saliba being sent for an early bath. With just minutes remaining in proceedings, the teen, already booked, flew into a challenge in the visitors’ half. In his defence, Saliba actually got the ball, but his studs were very much showing, with it therefore having not come as too much of a surprise when a 2nd yellow was swiftly produced. Looked like Saliba went over the top with his challenge there. He was having a decent game before that but has shown moments of petulance tonight. #EFLTrophy pic.twitter.com/JPJcZ6dT9Z — Chris Wheatley (@ChrisWheatley_) December 8, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
