Manchester United survived yet another early scare to rally back for all 3 points at West Ham this evening, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that the Red Devils simply cannot function without Bruno Fernandes. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men made the trip to the capital a short time ago, for a meeting with David Moyes’ Hammers. It was the hosts who actually held the advantage in the Premier League table ahead of kick-off, aware that a 3-point haul would guide them to the dizzying heights of 3rd. United, though, despite their damaging midweek defeat to PSG in the Champions League, were no doubt also confident ahead of kick-off, having looked a markedly superior side on the road to this point in the domestic campaign. This was evidenced once again last weekend, when the Manchester giants roared back from 2 goals down to secure a comeback victory at Southampton. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1288438573-1024x683.jpg" alt="Individual brilliance saves Solskjaer’s blushes vs West Ham but Man United’s Fernandes dependence should be a concern"/> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: Edinson Cavani of Manchester United celebrates after he heads in and scores a goal to make it 3-2 during the Premier League match between Southampton and Manchester United at St Mary’s Stadium on November 29, 2020 in Southampton, England.

West Ham took the lead in the clash late in the first-half, when Declan Rice’s flicked header to the back post was slotted home from close range by Tomas Soucek: SOUCEK TAPS HAMMERS IN FRONT!

At this point, the Reds were firmly in the ascendancy, with West Ham having looked a shadow of the side who carried the lead into the break. As such, it subsequently came as little surprise when, just inside the closing quarter of an hour, United put themselves out of sight with a 3rd of the evening. The goal, courtesy of Marcus Rashford, came at the end of another wonderful team move. After Paul Pogba’s pass into midfield was laid off to Juan Mata by Bruno Fernandes, the Spaniard directed an inch-perfect ball over the top of the West Ham backline into Rashford’s path, to dink a cool finish over the onrushing Fabianski. On an evening when Manchester United secured a 5th-straight Premier League win on the road to move back into the English top-flight’s top-4, it feels a tad harsh to be critical of Solskjaer’s men. However, it would also be remiss not to highlight the fact that, for 45 minutes this evening, the Reds were not only outplayed, but frankly embarrassed by David Moyes’ West Ham. The Irons played their illustrious opponents off the park throughout the first-half, and should have made their dominance count with at least two more goals – Pablo Fornals saw an effort come back off the post, whilst Sebastien Haller somehow managed to fluff his lines with the goal at his mercy. The entire momentum of the matchup swung, however, on the back of a pair of half-time changes on the part of the visitors. Edinson Cavani and Donny van de Beek were hauled off, with Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes introduced in their places. Rashford, to his credit, made a telling impact, with his pace and directness having caused the Hammers’ backline a whole host of problems. Once again, though, it was Fernandes who acted as the true driving force behind United’s turnaround victory. The Portuguese has carried his scintillating form from the 2nd-half of last season into the early weeks of the new campaign, to establish himself as, by some distance, United’s most important player. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276792356-1024x681.jpg" alt="Individual brilliance saves Solskjaer’s blushes vs West Ham but Man United’s Fernandes dependence should be a concern"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 26: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United celebrates after scoring his sides third goal during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester United at American Express Community Stadium on September 26, 2020 in Brighton, England.

(Photo by Glyn Kirk – Pool/Getty Images) Herein, however, lies the problem. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has become completely dependent on the brilliance of his side’s midfield maestro. The first-half this evening, with Fernandes on the bench in a bid to secure some much-needed rest, saw the Red Devils look completely lost. United’s midfield lacked any form of basic tempo or flow, with the lack of a link between defence and attack having nullified any attacking threat on the away side’s part. In turn, West Ham simply waited for the Manchester outfit to inevitably surrender possession due to a lack of options, before surging forward on the break. Solskjaer was, for 45 minutes, on the receiving end of a managerial lesson from David Moyes. This all changed, however, upon Fernandes stepping onto the London Stadium pitch. The former Sporting CP man completely changed the flow of the clash, picking up pockets of space in front of the West Ham backline to leave the hosts chasing shadows. His clever burst and layoff set up Pogba’s opener, with Fernandes having also slipped Marcus Rashford through to strike the post, before playing a central role in his side’s 3rd of the evening. Rashford, Greenwood and Pogba of course all came up big with moments of individual brilliance, but it was Fernandes who, almost single-handedly, turned the tide in the capital. The 26-year-old simply makes Manchester United tick. 8 – Only one player has created more chances in a single match in this season’s Premier League than Bruno Fernandes did against West Ham today and the United midfielder only played 45 minutes.

What if (knock on wood) Fernandes picks up an injury? What if it is a long-term one? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be stupid not to continue to utilise his side’s midfield conductor on as frequent a basis as possible. But the United boss must also have other plans, ideas and tactics at the ready for when Fernandes, at some point, is inevitably not available. Evidently, based on the first-half this evening, no such plans have yet been put in place, making the Reds, as things stand, completely and utterly dependent on the talents of their talismanic man in the middle.
