Thankfully, where mankind exists, so does innovation and via the internet, we were able to stay connected to our favourite artistes via their music, social media, online performances and even take front stage with social media challenges they put up. <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tiwa-Mayorkun-Simi--640x360.jpeg" alt="Top 10 Nigerian Music Challenges that Rocked Social Media in 2020"/> Top 10 Nigerian Music Challenges that Rocked Social Media in 2020 As we wrap up the year, here are 10 social media music challenges and campaigns that made the online sphere alive in 2020: 1.
