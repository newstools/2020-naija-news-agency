Roads leading to the scene of the explosion were said to have been cordoned off causing gridlock along the Dugbe, Ring Road, and Iyaganku areas in the state capital. An okada rider, who identified himself as Suraj Adewale, told our correspondent that the tanker fell around 12noon, but it eventually caught fire about two hours later. The Oyo State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Uche Chukwura, confirmed the incident to our correspondent on the telephone. The sector commander said, “A tanker fell this afternoon, and it eventually caught fire. Our men are there to control the traffic.” News AddThis : Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York Disable advertisements :Original Article
