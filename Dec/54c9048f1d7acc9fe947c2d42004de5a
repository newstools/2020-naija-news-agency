Arsenal fell to yet another defeat at Everton this evening, with the name of one Gunners star in particular having since taken the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Mikel Arteta’s men made the trip to Goodison Park a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. The Gunners of course entered proceedings in desperate need of a positive result, having slipped to 15th in the English top-flight table amid a frankly embarrassing run of just 1 win from their last 9. When all was said and done on Merseyside, however, it was high-flying Everton who emerged with all 3 points, plunging Arsenal further into crisis in the process. The hosts took the lead in the clash with 22 minutes on the clock, when former Gunner Alex Iwobi’s cross from the right was nodded onto the unfortunate Rob Holding by Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who unknowingly directed his attempted clearance beyond Bernd Leno and in: EVERTON LEAD Alex Iwobi’s cross is flicked on by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Arsenal’s stand-in captain Rob Holding puts it into his own net!

After Tom Davis felled Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the Everton box, Nicolas Pepe stepped up to slot away the ensuing spot-kick in confident fashion: PEPE KEEPS HIS COOL Tom Davis hands the Gunners a great chance from the spot and Nicolas Pepe makes no mistake!

On the stroke of the interval, a whipped corner from the left saw Yerry Mina break free at the front post, to direct a powerful header into the roof of the net, despite the best efforts of Bernd Leno. The Gunners again recovered well, emerging for the 2nd-half with renewed vigour, and even rattling the woodwork through David Luiz. However, a complete and utter lack of guile, in the end, cost Arsenal dear once more, as the capital giants’ attempts to level things up for a 2nd time fell flat. The clash, in turn, petered out into a 2-1 Everton win, as the problems facing Mikel Arteta and co. deepened even further. 14 – Arsenal’s points return from 14 games this season is their worst record at this stage since the 1974-75 campaign (12 points, converted to 3/win). Desperate. pic.twitter.com/wowPbSkoXe — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 19, 2020 On the back of proceedings coming to a close at Goodison Park, there are, as has repeatedly proven the case when analysing Arsenal of late, almost too many issues to fit into one article. The north Londoners were again crying out for a consistent creative presence in the attacking third, looked less than solid in defending set-pieces, and, over lengthy stretches, simply appeared unaware of what their actual game plan entailed. In all honestly, Everton did not even perform particularly well this evening. But the Toffees were let off the hook by an Arsenal side being led further and further down the rabbit hole by Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard, viewed at one point last season as the next up-and-coming tactician in English football, now looks nothing short of lost, with some of the recent decision making on his part having mirrored that of a complete amateur. Whilst tactical shortcomings can at least be excused by players attempting to learn new systems and adapt to a particular style of football, what is completely inexcusable is persisting with those who are simply not pulling their weight. Case and point: Willian. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228468270.jpg" alt="Everton 2-1 Arsenal: Bizarre Willian stat sums up Gunners’ woes as Arteta’s blind loyalty criticised again"/> Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (right) celebrates scoring his side’s third goal of the game with da Silva Willian during the Premier League match at Craven Cottage, London. (Photo by Ben Stanstall/PA Images via Getty Images) Brazilian wide-man Willian has proven central to Arsenal’s struggles of late, contributing next to nothing from an attacking standpoint, whilst also putting in minimal effort on the defensive side of the ball. Yet, in spite of a string of performances which it does not seem harsh to label as utterly shocking, Mikel Arteta has persisted with the former Chelsea man. Willian has now been handed starts in 12 of his side’s 14 Premier League outings this season, whilst the likes of Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith-Rowe and even Mesut Ozil watch on from the sidelines. The following statistic in and of itself, for example, should almost be enough to justify Willian not seeing the pitch again this side of the new year: Willian has had ONE shot on target in his last ELEVEN Premier League appearances!!!! pic.twitter.com/WfkhRtCiMq — AFTV (@AFTVMedia) December 19, 2020 Unsurprisingly, the Arsenal faithful, in turn, have since flooded to social media to make their frustrations with their manager clear, with some of the highlights showcased below: Managers don’t fail because of one player, but Mikel Arteta pushed for Willian, got Willian and is persisting with Willian. And at every stage it seems a mistake. — Daniel Storey (@danielstorey85) December 19, 2020 I really like Arteta but he should arguably be sacked for keeping Willian on. — James Dall (@JamesDall_) December 19, 2020 Charles, please ask Arteta why he starts Willian and keeps him on the pitch when he’s total fucking garbage. Thanks, from all Arsenal fans across the world. — SamW (@SamW_AFC) December 19, 2020 Every minute Willian spends on the pitch is a minute I lose faith in Arteta and it’s been that way for quite some time. — Chris Godfrey (@ChrisPJGodfrey) December 19, 2020 It’s hard to defend Arteta when he leaves Willian on for 90 mins. When we see no passion, no patterns of play and if teams win their games in hand, we are going into the relegation zone. Relegation is not impossible. Stop being ignorant. — PB (@OliPriceBates) December 19, 2020 As much as I like Arteta, you can’t keep persisting with your favorites in this crisis. Why does Willian, who has done nothing this season keep on getting 90 minutes while a player like Emile Smith-Rowe who can at least give you something different is relegated. Inexcusable. — Eduardo Hagn (@EduardoHagn) December 19, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
