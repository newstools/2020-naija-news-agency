From his managers, Jada and Sunday Are to Meji Alabi, Sarz, Legendury Beatz, Juls, Kel P, London and other producers, stylists and members of his team. Ten years ago I started my journey, from my home in Ojuelegba, to realise my ambition of becoming a global superstar. In the years since, I am blessed to say I have succeeded, and honoured that I did not do it alone. From the producers who have always understood me and brought to life my vision, to the artists with whom I collaborate and build with; from my management team who work behind the scenes, and my three children, who this legacy is all for.
