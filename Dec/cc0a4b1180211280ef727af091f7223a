Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that he remains hopeful Georginio Wijnaldum will, despite widespread reports to the contrary, put pen to paper on a new deal with Liverpool. Dutch international Wijnaldum has been on the books of Liverpool since the summer of 2016. And, despite his arrival from Premier League rivals Newcastle having initially gone somewhat under the radar, the 30-year-old has gone on to establish himself as an absolutely integral member of Jurgen Klopp’s midfield over the years since. Wijnaldum has started no less than 27 league games in each of his 4 seasons at Anfield, including all but three of the Reds’ league fixtures en route to English top-flight glory in 2019/20. The Feyenoord youth product’s brace in Liverpool’s stunning Champions League semi-final comeback versus Barcelona last year, meanwhile, saw Wijnaldum etch his name indellibly into club folklore. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1147626567-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jurgen Klopp reiterates hope of Wijnaldum stay as Dutchman’s van Dijk tribute vs Wolves revealed"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – MAY 07: Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal with Trent Alexander-Arnold during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final second leg match between Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield on May 07, 2019 in Liverpool, England.

This comes with the all-action midfielder’s contract at Anfield due to expire next summer, and new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman known to have been keen on the services of his fellow countryman during the summer: Gini Wijnaldum remains Ronald Koeman’s first choice target for Barcelona but a deal with Liverpool is “complicated”. [@FabrizioRomano] — Anfield Edition (@AnfieldEdition) September 14, 2020 Recent reports, meanwhile, have gone as far as to suggest that Liverpool are essentially ‘resigned’ to the fact that Wijnaldum will indeed be moving on in 2021. As outlined above, however, one individual who has evidently not yet given up all hope of the Dutchman springing a surprise, and staying put, is Jurgen Klopp. Speaking on the back of his side’s 4-0 drubbing of Wolves on Sunday, the Liverpool boss was drawn on Wijnaldum’s future, with a particular emphasis on the possibility of the former Newcastle man staying put: ‘I hope so [that he signs], to be honest,’ Klopp told Amazon Sport. ‘You can see that, he plays all the time. We have a pretty good relationship. I hope so.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1188583591-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jurgen Klopp"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 14: Jurgen Klopp the head coach / manager of Liverpool during the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Watford FC at Anfield on December 14, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

The 30-year-old’s subsequent celebration, meanwhile, had since garnered much attention, with ‘Gini’, in turn, having gone on to confirm during a post-match interview that his actions actually came as a tribute to sidelined teammate Virgil van Dijk: ‘I said that every goal that I score this year, I’m going to dedicate to him.’ Gini dedicated his goal to Van Dijk – who was watching on from the stands!  https://t.co/43OLGDWW1y — This Is Anfield (@thisisanfield) December 7, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
