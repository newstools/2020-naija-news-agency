Ajax manager Erik ten Hag has come out in defence of Quincy Promes after the Dutch forward was arrested on suspicion of stabbing. The former Sevilla winger was accused of the serious incident which occurred back in July of this year. Having played in Ajax’s weekend fixture, the Dutch international was then arrested by authorities and then released days later. With Promes still to be charged and detained of the stabbing which, if found guilty, could face as many as four years in prison, Ajax coach Ten Hag intends to use his star forward until the player is found guilty. “For us he is innocent, as long as the contrary is proven,” the coach said. “It affects us, it affects me, it affects the whole dressing room. I’ve talked to Quincy, he’s fine now, although it does something to a person. “ “He says he is innocent. We support him by being there for him, that’s the whole dressing room in it. We are going to help him, but he must also do something himself, he must also cross the line himself. You are always a football player, even when you are outside the Ajax gates “ The Dutch international was not in the squad for the cup match against Utrecht but could be in line for the league fixture at the weekend. Ajax dropped into the Europa League after defeat in Amsterdam against Atalanta. Ten Hag spoke afterwards about his disappointment of dropping but stressed how important it is for the side not to let their heads drop. “We will continue in the Europa League. Ajax knows very well where that can lead, but we also know what happened last year. You will have to go through the next round first,” he said. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture10-1024x728.jpg" alt="LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 01: Sadio Mane of Liverpool is challenged by Perr Schuurs of Ajax during the UEFA Champions League Group D stage match between Liverpool FC and Ajax Amsterdam at Anfield on December 01, 2020 in Liverpool, England.
