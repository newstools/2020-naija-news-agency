Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has provided an explanation for Christian Pulisic’s absence from his matchday squad to take on Everton tonight. The Blues are currently locked in action with Carlo Ancelotti’s men at Goodison Park. Chelsea of course headed into proceedings with spirits high in the club’s camp, amid a scintillating spell of recent form. The capital giants’ last outing saw them held to a 1-1 draw by Krasnodar on Tuesday, albeit in a meaningless final day Champions League group stage clash. Nevertheless, this extended the unbeaten streak being enjoyed by Lampard’s men to a remarkable 14 games across all competitions, as the Londoners’ summer recruitment drive begins to pay dividends. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg" alt="Explanation provided for Christian Pulisic’s Chelsea absence vs Everton"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 07: Thiago Silva of Chelsea celebrates with teammate Ben Chilwell after scoring his team’s third goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on November 07, 2020 in London, England.

In fact, the Toffees have managed just a single win from their last 7 in the league. As such, Chelsea no doubt headed into proceedings at Goodison confident of bagging all 3 points, a result which would launch the Pensioners back to the summit of the Premier League. One individual, however, who is set to play no part in the visitors’ efforts to do so, is Christian Pulisic.
