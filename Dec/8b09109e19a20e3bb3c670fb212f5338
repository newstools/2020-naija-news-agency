Chelsea return to Premier League action this coming Saturday. The Blues face a trip to Goodison Park in the day’s late kick-off. Chelsea head into the tie in sensational form both domestically and in Europe. The Londoners topped their Champions League group without losing a single tie and conceding just two in the process. And in the league they are up to 3rd place, two points off top spot, having lost just once all season. Everton, meanwhile, after a superb start to the campaign, have now picked up just one win in their last five Premier League ties, seeing them slip down to 9th in the table. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg" alt="Lampard praises Ancelotti’s influence on him ahead of Chelsea vs Everton"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea gives his team instructions during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

He is right at the top when I speak about the managers I’ve worked with for everything about him, the huge success he has had at a number of clubs. “One to one I found him to be a great coach, a great man and I look forward at all times to seeing him and speaking to him.” Quotes via Goal.
