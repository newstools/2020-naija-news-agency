Here are some facts about his career: On what he’s doing to make a difference in the profession, his community, the world? Outside of my firm, I enjoy teaching the next generation of accountants. I fell into academics. I had the opportunity to teach an accounting class at a local community college and I realized I loved my interactions with all levels of learners. Mentorship has been a natural extension of my love of teaching. As a minority in the accounting field, I hope I inspire other minorities to pursue accounting, specifically becoming a Certified Public Accountant. By helping all future accountants develop, I, by extension impact the financial health of local, national, and international homes and businesses.
