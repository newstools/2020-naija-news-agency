Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this afternoon provided fitness updates on star attackers Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani. It is safe to say that the last week has not proven a particularly positive one for United. The Red Devils of course made the trip to Germany on Tuesday evening, for their biggest outing of the campaign thus far. This came with the club’s Champions League fate hanging in the balance, on the back of 2 defeats in their previous 3 outings in the competition. When all was said and done at the Red Bull Arena, however, despite a spirited late comeback, Solskjaer’s men fell short, in a 3-2 defeat at the hands of RB Leipzig. The Manchester giants, in turn, will now continue their European campaign in the Europa League over the 2nd-half of the season. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230019625-1024x683.jpg" alt="The latest on Anthony Martial &amp; Edinson Cavani ahead of the Manchester derby"/> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer leaves after the UEFA Champions League Group H football match RB Leipzig v Manchester United in Leipzig, eastern Germany, on December 8, 2020.

Incredibly, almost out of the blue, star midfielder Paul Pogba essentially sent a come and get me plea to European football’s giants, through representative Mino Raiola. Speaking in an interview with Italian outlet Tuttosport, super agent Raiola explained: ‘I can say that it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.’ ‘Paul is unhappy with Man United as he is no longer able to express himself in the way that he would like and as he is expected to. Paul needs a new team, a change of air. He is under contract for the next 18 months and it will expire in the summer of 2022.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1229960439.jpg" alt="The latest on Anthony Martial &amp; Edinson Cavani ahead of the Manchester derby"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 05: Paul Pogba of Manchester United celebrates scoring a goal to make the score 1-1 during the Premier League match between West Ham United and Manchester United at London Stadium on December 5, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The Reds are set to welcome Pep Guardiola’s men to Old Trafford in a little under 24 hours’ time, aiming to reclaim their spot in the Premier League’s top-4. And, ahead of his side’s crunch derby clash, as outlined above, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer today provided updates on the fitness of a pair of key members of his squad. The players in question? Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani. Both attackers missed the club’s midweek defeat in Leipzig, after picking up respective injury problems during a 3-1 win at West Ham days prior. Solskjaer, though, confirmed that Martial has since returned to full fitness, whilst Cavani is back in training, and could be in line to feature on Saturday, too: Anthony will definitely be involved and Edinson has been on the grass today. But I’m not sure if he’ll make it. Apart from that, we’ve had a couple of days of recovery and we should be ready. The boss has shared his latest squad update, which includes good news on our no. #MUFC #MUNMCI — Manchester United (@ManUtd) December 11, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
