The final 3-man shortlists for a pair of highly sought after individual accolades dished out by FIFA have been revealed online on Friday. The first comes in the form of the Puskas award. The Puskas, handed out on an annual basis, was introduced in 2009, to highlight the finest goals scored across the globe over the course of the previous year. Previous winners include the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The latest batch of 11 nominees were revealed two weeks ago, with fans having since been handed the opportunity to vote for their personal favourite. In turn, the shortlist for the prize has today been whittled down to just 3, from which the final victor will be announced on December 17th.

Of the 4 editions of the accolade to have been handed out since its inception in 2016, Cristiano Ronaldo has bagged two, with Luka Modric having come up trumps in 2018. The current holder, meanwhile, is Lionel Messi. It will come as no surprise, meanwhile, to see both Barcelona’s talisman, and long-time rival Ronaldo, on FIFA’s final shortlist this time around, with the pair joined on the podium by Bayern Munich hitman Robert Lewandowski, viewed by many as the favourite for this year’s prize: Introducing the finalists for The Best FIFA Men’s Player 2020 @Cristiano @lewy_official Lionel Messi#TheBest | #FIFAFootballAwards pic.twitter.com/II15QxBxG4 — FIFA.com (@FIFAcom) December 11, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
