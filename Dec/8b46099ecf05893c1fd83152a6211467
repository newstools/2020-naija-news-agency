Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided a fitness update on his squad, ahead of their fast-approaching meeting with Burnley. The Gunners of course returned to Europa League action on Thursday night, in a meeting with Irish outfit Dundalk. Arteta’s men had long booked their spot in the competition’s last-16, but were nevertheless no doubt keen to finish the club’s group campaign boasting a perfect 6-for-6 win record. And, when all was said and done in Dublin a little over 24 hours ago, this is precisely what Arsenal managed. A weakened visitors XI cruised to a relatively comfortable 4-2 victory, to keep their European momentum very much alive. “Pick that out for a goal!” Mohamed Elneny unleashes a beauty from way out! #UEL pic.twitter.com/u7nYJZDqiY — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 10, 2020 Whilst the north Londoners have continued to thrive on the continent of late, however, the same cannot be said of Arsenal’s efforts on the domestic front. On the back of a solid opening to the campaign, the Gunners’ Premier League form has fallen off a cliff of late. A run of just 1 win from their last 7 has seen Arteta’s men slip to a lowly 15th in the English top-flight, ahead of this weekend’s latest round of fixtures. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="Arsenal boss Arteta on Gabriel Martinelli’s return &amp; Thomas Partey’s fitness"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

The Clarets currently sit in the Premier League relegation zone, having managed just one win to this point in the season. In turn, Mikel Arteta is no doubt desperate to have as many of the key members of his squad available for selection in 48 hours’ time. One individual, however, who will play no part versus Burnley, is Thomas Partey. Speaking on the back of his side’s victory over Dundalk, Arteta was asked for an update on summer arrival Partey, who was forced off late in the first-half of Arsenal’s North London Derby defeat to Spurs last weekend. And the Gunners boss went on to reveal: ‘Thomas is out for a few games. It is the same area where he got injured previously and we will have to see how long it takes to heal.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1289744151-1024x707.jpg" alt="Arsenal boss Arteta on Gabriel Martinelli’s return &amp; Thomas Partey’s fitness"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 06: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg of Tottenham Hotspur battles for possession with Thomas Partey of Arsenal during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on December 06, 2020 in London, England.

On the back of a lengthy layoff, youngster Martinelli returned to action for Arsenal’s U21s earlier this week, in a meeting with AFC Wimbledon. The Brazilian was hooked at half-time in the clash, though, leading to immediate concern surrounding a possible setback. Arteta has moved to quell such fears, however, assuring that Martinelli’s exit was simply precautionary, with the 19-year-old having since taken part in first-team training: ‘Martinelli played his 45 minutes for a long time and came through OK and has trained.’ Arsenal’s latest team news right here: https://t.co/B7ZvSfrDB6 — football.london (@Football_LDN) December 11, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
