Any hopes on the part of Premier League giants Arsenal of striking a winter deal for Houssem Aouar have today been dashed by none other than the Lyon star himself. 22-year-old midfielder Aouar was of course hotly-tipped for a move to north London during the summer. As Mikel Arteta went in search of reinforcements to his side’s ranks in the middle of the park, Aouar was one of two midfielders identified as a key target. The other, meanwhile, was Thomas Partey. In the end, the Gunners opted to splash the cash on the latter, activating Partey’s Atletico Madrid release clause on transfer deadline day last month. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg" alt="Houssem Aouar deals Arsenal transfer blow with transfer admission"/> Arsenal’s Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey (L) vies with Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba (R) during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on November 1, 2020.

Recent weeks have seen the complete lack of a creative spark at Mikel Arteta’s disposal (as Mesut Ozil remains frozen out) widely highlighted, with a midfielder capable of both setting up teammates and finding the back of the net himself expected to be next on the Gunners’ wishlist. In turn, a fresh swoop for Aouar, potentially as early as January, has inevitably been touted. As outlined above, however, if the latest comments on the part of the Frenchman himself are anything to go by, then an Emirates switch, during the winter window at least, appears off the table. On Monday, Aouar held an in-depth interview with RMC Sport. During the discussion, a number of noteworthy topics were touched upon, including the Lyon standout’s recent exclusion from Les Gones’ squad to take on Reims. The key takeaway, when it comes to Aouar’s future at least, however, came when the 22-year-old was drawn on a potential departure from the Groupama Stadium. Aouar went on to completely shut down the possibility of such a move coming to fruition in January, before hinting that he could even remain on the books of his long-time club beyond next summer: Houssem Aouar rules out January move. ‘I’ll be Lyon until next summer, at least,’ he tells RMC after downplaying his exclusion from the squad at the weekend — Matt Spiro (@mattspiro) November 30, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
