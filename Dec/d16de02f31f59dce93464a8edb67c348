Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola this afternoon opened up on his plans for star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne over the hectic Christmas period. The Sky Blues are set to return to action on Saturday. Guardiola’s men will make the trip to St. Mary’s, for a Premier League meeting with high-flying Southampton. City head into the Saints clash amid an altogether hit-and-miss spell of form, perfectly summing up the club’s campaign to this point. After picking up 4 wins from 5 across all competitions, the Citizens have since failed to secure victories in either of their last two league outings. The latest of these came on Tuesday night, when, despite dominating in both possession and chances created, the Manchester giants were unable to push past relegation candidates West Brom at the Etihad. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1191016359-1024x683.jpg" alt="Pep Guardiola"/> NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 30: Pep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City looks on prior to the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Manchester City at St. James Park on November 30, 2019 in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

Ahead of his side’s trip to the South East, meanwhile, as is customary, Pep Guardiola today held his latest pre-match press conference. A number of topics were discussed during the media exchange, including the importance of City’s stars sharing the goalscoring burden, and the threat posed by Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse. Perhaps the most noteworthy – when it comes to the plans of Fantasy Premier League managers at least – though, was an insight into Guardiola’s plans to utilise Kevin De Bruyne over the weeks ahead. The tinkering of the Sky Blues boss has of course long proven a pain to deal with for FPL bosses, with Guardiola never afraid to afford his star performers a night off when necessary. As such, it came as something of a surprise this afternoon when the Spaniard confirmed that he in fact has no such plans for Kevin De Bruyne over the busy festive period, with the midfield creator simply too ‘important’ to leave out: ‘He is so important for us right now that he won’t rest. He rested in the Champions League, he rested in other weeks previously and right now we need him.’ Pep Guardiola points to the #mcfc plan with Kevin De Bruyne over Christmas https://t.co/rtbay1c50d — Manchester City News (@ManCityMEN) December 18, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
