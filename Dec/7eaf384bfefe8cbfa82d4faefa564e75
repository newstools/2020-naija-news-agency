The campaign was a part of the brand’s response to mitigate the effects of the economic downturn resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic especially among disadvantaged families where the scourge was most felt across the country. <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beneficiary-and-Titilope-Reju-Brand-Manager-Blue-Band-Nigeria-2-scaled.jpg"/> The Spreading Smiles initiative, which aimed at rewarding 100 disadvantaged families across Nigeria with a cash benefit of N50,000 each, involved the participation of Blue Band consumers, presenting them with an opportunity to nominate a family in need. The process required that for every Twin Tub Pack of 250g, 450g, or 900g purchased, using a code provided on each pack, consumers got the chance to nominate a family that they believed would benefit from financial assistance. <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beneficiary-and-Titilope-Reju-Brand-Manager-Blue-Band-Nigeria-3.jpg"/> Speaking at the presentation, Francis Afoani, (Head of Marketing, Upfield – West Africa), said, “We are glad about the outcome of the campaign, as it has further demonstrated our commitment to help parents grow healthy and happy kids.
