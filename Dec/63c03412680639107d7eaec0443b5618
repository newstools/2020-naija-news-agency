Olivier Giroud scored four goals for Chelsea in an impressive display against a Seville side who are typically very strong at home. The French striker is gradually closing in on the French all-time goalscoring record but has been struggling for consistent game time with Chelsea. Timo Werner and Tammy Abraham have both been getting the nod over Giroud but with Leeds United awaiting at the weekend, Frank Lampard may not have much choice but to reward Giroud with a start at the weekend. The French striker was however humble and coy over the idea of a start at the weekend. “Well yeah when you win a Champions League away game its always a great feeling and a good performance from the team. We took the game from the front foot, and we have been efficient up front also for me because I score four goals.” “Yeah I didn’t know it before two years ago that you call it a perfect hattrick,” Giroud said speaking to BT Sport when reminded he had scored with his right and left foot in addition to a headed goal. “When I score against Kiev in the Europa League they told me that and I said what do you mean?” Giroud has a perfect hat-trick!

After we will rest and we will see what the gaffer’s plan is.” Olivier Giroud’s future at Arsenal is still unsure and there is a real chance that the French forward could still leave Chelsea in January if he is not given assurances about game time. With the European Championships fast approaching in the summer, Giroud is up against plenty of forward talent to be picked. Kylian Mbappe, Wissam Ben Yedder, Antoine Griezmann and Anthony Martial are all vying for a spot. Deschamps has said that Giroud may need to consider a move in order to have a better chance of selection. “Olivier Giroud knows it – the situation he’s in today cannot drag on forever. Before March he will have to find another situation than this one,” said the France coach. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-05-17.jpg" alt="Giroud hattrick leaves Chelsea manager Frank Lampard with striker selection conundrum"/> PARIS, FRANCE – MARCH 28: Didier Deschamps, coach of France smiles during the International Friendly match between France and Spain at Stade de France on March 28, 2017 in Paris, France.

He has had situations that have sometimes been complicated to deal with. “Today, it is not good for him. Will it stay the same or will it improve? It’s up to him. He knows what I think, even if I don’t forget everything he has done and everything he would still be able to do.” The France squad will be named early next year and with plenty of time for Giroud to find a new ‘situation’ if it is deemed necessary.
