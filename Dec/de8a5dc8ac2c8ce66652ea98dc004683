Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has provided an insight the reasoning behind the lack of playing time afforded to Riqui Puig to this point in the campaign. 21-year-old Puig is a product of the famed La Masia academy. The midfielder was long viewed as one of the finest talents to have blossomed in the Barca youth system in recent years, resulting in his eventual integration into the club’s first-team setup during the 2018/19 campaign. Last season saw the technically-gifted Spaniard’s game-time increase further, en route to 11 La Liga appearances, including a respectable 5 starts. In turn, with Puig having generally looked impressive when handed the opportunity to showcase his talents, the Blaugrana faithful no doubt expected their side’s academy graduate to stake a claim for a first-choice midfield berth this season. To this point, however, this has proven some way from the case. In fact, on the back of Ronald Koeman’s arrival in Catalunya, Puig has been afforded just a solitary league appearance, amounting to a grand total of 3 minutes. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1229132986-1024x683.jpg" alt="‘I like people who work every day…’ – Barcelona boss Koeman aims dig at Riqui Puig"/> GETAFE, SPAIN – OCTOBER 17: (BILD ZEITUNG OUT) Riqui Puig of FC Barcelona controls the ball during the La Liga Santader match between Getafe CF and FC Barcelona at Coliseum Alfonso Perez on October 17, 2020 in Getafe, Spain.

Large sections of the Barcelona faithful have made crystal clear their frustrations with their manager’s treatment of Puig of late, with the Catalan giants of course not exactly thriving in his absence. As such, speaking ahead of his side’s latest outing, a meeting with Valencia on Saturday afternoon, Ronald Koeman was today drawn on the 21-year-old’s continued absence from his starting XI. And the ever-bullish Dutchman certainly did not hold back with his response. Koeman appeared to aim a dig at Puig’s work ethic, insisting that ‘it’s not just about quality’ when attempting to earn game-time under his watch: Ronald Koeman, when asked about Riqui Puig: “I like people who work every day to improve, and who take opportunities with both hands. Sometimes it’s not just about quality. There may be players who don’t do enough in training for the coach to give opportunities” #FCB — Reshad Rahman ✆ (@HagridFCB) December 18, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
