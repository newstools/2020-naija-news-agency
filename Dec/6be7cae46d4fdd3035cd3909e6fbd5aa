Updates on the fitness of a number of Chelsea’s stars have surfaced online this evening, ahead of the Blues’ meeting with West Ham. Frank Lampard’s men are set to return to Premier League action on Monday evening, when they welcome the Hammers to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea will of course enter the derby clash in desperate search of a bounce-back result. The capital outfit, on the back of a 14-game unbeaten streak across all competitions, have since fallen to consecutive losses in their last two outings. A 1-0 downing at Everton last weekend was followed during the week by a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Wolves, results which have seen Chelsea slip to 8th in the English top-flight table. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230090424-1024x683.jpg" alt="Potential hammer blow for Chelsea as Reece James may require surgery/Ziyech latest ahead of West Ham"/> Chelsea’s German midfielder Kai Havertz (R) runs with the ball as Everton’s English midfielder Ben Godfrey (L) close in during the English Premier League football match between Everton and Chelsea at Goodison Park in Liverpool, north west England on December 12, 2020.

David Moyes’ men have looked a much improved side to this point in the campaign, managing 4 wins from their last 6 in the Premier League. As such, Frank Lampard was no doubt hopeful of having as many of his key players available for selection as possible on Monday night. But, as outlined above, with just 48 hours to go ahead of kick-off in southwest London, the Blues have this evening been dealt a potentially serious blow on the personnel front. As revealed by the reliable Simon Johnson of The Athletic, Reece James, who has of course proven an integral member of the club’s backline thus far this season, is struggling with a knee problem. In turn, the English international was forced to undergo a scan earlier today. And, worryingly, it is claimed that, should the results of the scan not prove of a positive nature, James may well be forced under the knife: Exclusive: Reece James went for a scan today and may need an operation. I’ve also provided an update on the chances of Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi playing for #CFC against #WHUFC. Full story here:https://t.co/o3NDmt6fuI — Simon Johnson (@SJohnsonSport) December 19, 2020 Updates on Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi, meanwhile, were also provided in The Athletic’s report. Both attackers have spent time on the sidelines of late, with the creative influence of the former in particular having been badly missed by Chelsea in their last two outings. Ziyech, though, despite having returned to first-team training, appears unlikely to face West Ham as things stand. Hudson-Odoi, on the other hand, is also back in training, and is viewed as closer to being in contention to feature on Monday.
