The official statement from the management was; Due to fears/scares of COVID-19, we recognize that the safety of the fans comes first. While Davido on his personal Instagram page wrote; Following increased and overwhelming concerns with the rise of Covid-19 cases in Lagos, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the upcoming 'Davido Presents DMW Live In Concert' scheduled to take place on Dec 28th. The health and well-being of our fans, employees and artists is of paramount importance so whilst we are disappointed, we know it is the right thing to do. Thank you to everyone that purchased tables. Your support brought us way closer to sold out status than we expected in a very uncertain time! We look forward to bringing you a DMW live in concert in the very near future. In the meantime, stay safe, sanitised and socially distanced. Thank you for your understanding and Merry Christmas in advance!
