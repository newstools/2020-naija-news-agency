According to the 2020 PwC, Impact of Women on Nigeria’s Economy, Nigerian women account for 41% ownership of micro-businesses in Nigeria with 23 million female entrepreneurs operating within this segment. This places Nigeria among the highest entrepreneurship rates globally. Although the high-level participation of female entrepreneurs in the country is positive, it is however often driven mainly by necessity, which is the norm in emerging markets where there is insufficient formal employment. <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607958536722_image_6487327.jpg"/> The Founder of the AGS Tribe and Entrepreneur, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, since 2018, has championed a support system for young women through a virtual community of female professionals and entrepreneurs. Through this community, Ifedayo leads to a growing movement of women who now easily access grants, training opportunities, mentoring, and access to business leaders across various sectors of the economy. After being inspired to write a book, Accessing Grants for Startups; she found a staggering dearth in resources for young people especially women, and decided to build a community of women who reached out at first with more questions about her book. Whilst most of the reforms by the current and past administrations are yet to fully take effect, it is expected that many more women will be empowered across the country through interventions and initiatives such as the AGSTribe. <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607958536343_image_6487327.jpg"/> <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607958538403_image_6487327.jpg"/> <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607958537090_image_6487327.jpg"/> <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607964694774_image_6487327.jpg"/> <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1607958538033_image_6487327.jpg"/> ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————BellaNaija.com is a partner for #HERconomy The post #HERconomy Conference was Thrilling and Impactful with Gov.
