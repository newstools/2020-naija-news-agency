An inside look into some of the finer details of a heated recent meeting at Arsenal’s training ground has been forthcoming online on Friday. To say that the opening months of the campaign have not gone according to plan for Mikel Arteta and co. would be putting it lightly. On the back of an FA Cup and Community Shield double in August, the widespread expectation surrounding Arsenal ahead of the new season was that the capital giants would swiftly kick on, to establish themselves back amongst the Premier League’s elite, or at the very least the top-4 battle. And the Gunners, to their credit, actually did enjoy a solid opening to the delayed domestic term, notching 3 wins from their first 4 league outings, as well as ousting both Leicester City and Liverpool from the League Cup. The weeks and months since, however, have proven nothing short of a disaster. Arsenal have gone on to notch just 1 further win from their 6 ensuing Premier League outings, a spell which has seen Arteta’s men slip to a lowly 14th in the English top-flight. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1288478495-1024x689.jpg" alt="‘Finger pointing &amp; raised voices’ – Insight provided into Arsenal squad’s clear-the-air meeting ahead of Spurs clash"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal looks on during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Emirates Stadium on November 29, 2020 in London, England.

As such, it does not feel like an exaggeration to state that, should things not turn around to at least some degree at the Emirates over the weeks ahead, Arsenal are on course to slip into full-blown crisis territory. One sure-fire way to get things back on track for the north Londoners, though, would be a 3-point haul this weekend. Arsenal are set to make the trip to the Tottenham Hotspur stadium on Sunday, for a derby showdown with table-topping Spurs. A positive result against Jose Mourinho’s in-form Lilywhites would no doubt go a long way towards temporarily silencing the critics, a fact which, if the latest word doing the rounds online this evening is to be believed, Mikel Arteta’s squad appear fully aware of. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229281834-1024x679.jpg" alt="‘Finger pointing &amp; raised voices’ – Insight provided into Arsenal squad’s clear-the-air meeting ahead of Spurs clash"/> Arsenal’s Spanish manager Mikel Arteta reacts during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Leicester City at the Emirates Stadium in London on October 25, 2020. – Leicester won the match 1-0.

The discussion was set up for any grievances within the club’s setup to be aired, in a bid to get to the bottom of the Londoners’ recent struggles. Following an initial exchange between both players and staff, Arteta and co. are later said to have departed, leaving the club’s stars to hash things out amongst themselves. And it was during this conversation that tensions reached a new level altogether, amid ‘finger-pointing’ and ‘raised voices’ on the part of a number of individuals. In the end, however, upon the ‘intense’ dialogue coming to a close, a squad-wide agreement was reached to put things right over the weeks ahead, beginning with this weekend’s derby.

Coaching staff left, players then held second ‘clear-the-air’ meeting involving angry exchanges but ended with resolve to improve.
