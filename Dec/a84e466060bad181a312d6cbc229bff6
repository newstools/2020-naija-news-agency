The latest word stemming from the French media on Sunday suggests that PSG are primed to open negotiations with Lyon over a move for Arsenal-linked Houssem Aouar. The major talking point at the Emirates throughout the latest transfer window of course surrounded the club’s chase of reinforcements in the middle of the park. Over the course of the summer, a whole host of midfield stars were linked with a move to north London. Chief among these, over lengthy stretches, were Lyon’s Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid standout Thomas Partey. In the end, having proven frustrated in their pursuit of the former, Arsenal opted to bring in Ghanaian international Partey, to add some much-needed presence to Mikel Arteta’s midfield ranks. And the 27-year-old certainly didn’t taken long in making his presence felt, bagging Man of the Match honours in his full Gunners debut versus Rapid Wien, before driving his new side to a long overdue win at Old Trafford last month. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg" alt="Arsenal to miss out?

Recent weeks have seen the complete lack of a creative spark at Mikel Arteta’s disposal (as Mesut Ozil remains frozen out) widely highlighted, with a midfielder capable of both setting up teammates and finding the back of the net himself expected to be next on the Gunners’ wishlist. The player most persistently tipped to fill this role ahead of the opening of the January window, up until recently, came in the form of Red Bull Salzburg sensation Dominik Szoboszlai. This was, however, until widespread confirmation was forthcoming earlier this week that the Hungarian is primed for a winter move to RB Leipzig: Sky sources: Dominik Szoboszlai to Leipzig is close to being done.

Both clubs want to announce the deal before Christmas #TransferUpdate https://t.co/ZpgXa4xUym — Max Bielefeld (@Sky_MaxB) December 11, 2020 In turn, it has quickly been suggested that Arsenal could switch their attentions back to the aforementioned Aouar. The Frenchman has endured an indifferent opening to the campaign with Lyon, with the financial crisis facing Ligue 1’s clubs following the collapse of the division’s TV rights deal representing a boost for any foreign clubs eyeing up stars plying their trade in the French top-flight. One Ligue 1 outfit, however, no doubt set to maintain a solid financial footing, are PSG. And it is the Parisians, who, if the latest word stemming from the media on Sunday is to be believed, could deal Arsenal a major blow, in taking advantage of the monetary struggles of their rivals. As per a report from RMC Sport, the board at the Parc des Princes have lined up talks with their Lyon counterparts next year, over the signing of Aouar. It remains unclear how keen the midfielder himself would be on the move, but the news will nevertheless come as a concern for Mikel Arteta and co. In addition to PSG, it is also noted that both Manchester City and Juventus are keeping a close eye on developments surrounding Aouar. #PSG and Lyon will hold talks over Houssem Aouar in the spring, RMC reports. Manchester City and Juventus also closely following the case. — Robin Bairner (@RBairner) December 13, 2020 Mikel Arteta refuses to rule out Mesut Ozil’s return to Arsenal setup following turn of year Arteta urges Arsenal’s Aubameyang not to overthink goalscoring drought Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
