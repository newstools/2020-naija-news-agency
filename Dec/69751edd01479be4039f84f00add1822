Everton have been dealt a major blow on the personnel front, ahead of the club’s upcoming meeting with Chelsea. Carlo Ancelotti’s men are set to return to return to action tomorrow night, in a high-profile meeting with the Pensioners at Goodison Park. The hosts will head into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, having seen their stellar early-season form fall off a cliff of late. Across the club’s last 7 Premier League outings, Everton have managed just a solitary win, the latest of which saw the Merseysiders held to a 1-1 draw by struggling Burnley last weekend. This stretch, in turn, has seen Everton slip to 9th in the English top-flight ahead of the upcoming gameweek. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture14-1024x649.jpg" alt="BURNLEY, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 05: Dominic Calvert-Lewin of Everton celebrates with teammate Richarlison after scoring his team&#039;s first goal during the Premier League match between Burnley and Everton at Turf Moor on December 05, 2020 in Burnley, England.

Chelsea sit just 2 points adrift of the Premier League summit as things stand, having not fallen to a single defeat across all competitions since being ousted from the League Cup by Spurs late in September. As such, for obvious reasons, it is the visitors who will head into proceedings at Goodison on Saturday as overwhelming favourites to bag all 3 points. And, as outlined above, the mountain facing Ancelotti and co. in a little over 24 hours’ time has today been made to look even steeper. This comes on the back of a major blow on the injury front. Speaking in his pre-match press conference this afternoon, the Everton boss was asked for a fitness update on his squad. And Ancelotti went on to reveal that all of captain Seamus Coleman, versatile midfielder Fabian Delph and, perhaps most significantly of all, summer addition James Rodriguez are set to miss out versus Chelsea, with respective injury problems: ‘He was not able to train, nothing special but he was not able to train’, Ancelotti explained regarding Rodriguez. ‘We have to look at him after the game, to see if he will be able to train and play against Leicester.’ | Carlo says we will be without James, Delph and Coleman for #EVECHE.
