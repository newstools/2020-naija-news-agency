Tottenham’s packed festive schedule continues this coming Sunday with a trip to Wolves. Spurs head into the tie on the back of booking their spot in this season’s League Cup semi-final. However, the north Londoner’s league form has actually taken something of a nosedive of late. Recent months have seen Spurs dominate the Premier League, and even be considered title challengers. However, Jose Mourinho’s side have since fallen to back-to-back defeats vs Liverpool and Leicester City. This has seen the Lilywhite’s move down to 6th spot, having picked up just one win from their last five PL ties. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1054182018-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tottenham’s Jose Mourinho labels Wolves a top-six side"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 27: Nuno Espirito Santo, Manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers looks looks on prior to the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers at American Express Community Stadium on October 27, 2018 in Brighton, United Kingdom.

Nuno Santo’s side start the weekend 11th in the English top-flight having lost three of their last four. However, ahead of the tie, Jose Mourinho was quick to hype up his latest opponents. When asked if Wolves should be considered a top-six side, the Portuguese stated: “I believe so.” Mourinho also moved to play down suggestions that Tottenham are now set for an easier run of matches: “It is very hard in this league to have a consistent run. Every game is very difficult. We were in a period where he had to play the considered top six teams where we played them in a row. Now people could say you are going to get an easier run of matches. What is easier? Go to Wolves, play Fulham and Aston Villa? It is not easier.” Jose Mourinho believes Wolves should now be considered a top-six Premier League team, as he prepares to take his Tottenham team to Molineux on Sunday. — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) December 24, 2020 See also: Aston Villa vs Crystal Palace betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
