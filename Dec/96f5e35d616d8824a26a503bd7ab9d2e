It would be Man City who knocked United out of the League Cup at this stage last season as well. However, this tie will only be over one leg, compared to the two normally played out in previous years. Ahead of what should be a tight affair, Nemanja Matic has spoken out and is seemingly full of confidence that his side can come out on top this time around, stating: “This time I hope we will use our chance; we will do our best. “I think that we are now in a better condition, a better moment. We play better football than last year, in my opinion. I’m very confident.” Quotes via Goal.
