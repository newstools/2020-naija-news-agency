Confirmation of Amad Diallo’s passport being processed as planned has today been forthcoming, in a boost for Manchester United ahead of the January window. Diallo, 18, was of course at the heart of one of a number of deadline day deals struck by the Red Devils this past October. The gifted attacker joined Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Facundo Pellistri in putting pen to paper on terms with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189206-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man United boost: Amad Diallo granted passport ahead of January arrival"/> PARIS, FRANCE – OCTOBER 20: Alex Telles of Manchester United in action during the UEFA Champions League Group H stage match between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United at Parc des Princes on October 20, 2020 in Paris, France.

This came despite the fact that he had managed just 3 prior senior league appearances for Atalanta. Diallo, though, unlike all of Cavani, Telles and Pellistri, did not actually make the move to Manchester in January. With the Reds having been waiting for international clearance and the processing of a new passport for their latest big-money addition, it was decided that Diallo would remain in Italy for the opening half of the campaign. But, as outlined above, the United faithful shouldn’t have to wait too much longer to catch a glimpse of the prodigious wide-man donning the colours of their club. As confirmed by transfer expert Fabrizio Romano a short time ago, Diallo today received his passport, with his transfer therefore set to go ahead as planned. The Ivorian, in turn, will travel to Manchester upon the opening of the winter window, ahead of completing his much anticipated United switch: Amad Diallo has finally received his passport, the deadlines have been respected. He will fly to Manchester in January to complete his move to Man United. €25m + €15m add ons to Atalanta.  @Amaddiallo79 #MUFC #ManUtd #transfers — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) December 18, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
