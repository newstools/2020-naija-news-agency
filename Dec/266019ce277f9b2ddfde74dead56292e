Chelsea’s U23 side made short work of their Manchester United counterparts this afternoon, with some of the Blues’ finest young talent having shone bright. Andy Myers’ outfit welcomed the Red Devils to Kingsmeadow a short time ago, for a Premier League 2 clash. The Londoners headed into proceedings amid a fine spell of form, which had seen them down Leicester and Tottenham in their prior two outings. In turn, Chelsea sat pretty atop the Premier League 2 table ahead of kick-off on Friday. And, as outlined above, when all was said and done in the English capital, Myers’ men only extended their advantage over the chasing pack. An absolutely blistering performance eventually saw Chelsea down Manchester United by 6 goals to 1. Incredibly, the Pensioners were two goals up within the opening 3 minutes of action, courtesy of finishes from Marcel Lewis and Jude Soonsup-Bell. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229832823-1024x682.jpg" alt="Tino Anjorin stakes latest first-team claim as Chelsea U23s thump Manchester United"/> KINGSTON UPON THAMES, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 28: Jude Soonsup-Bell of Chelsea back heels the ball for his forth goal during the FA Youth Cup round three match between Chelsea U18 and Barnsley U18 at Kingsmeadow on December 12, 2020 in Kingston upon Thames, England.

Lewis was next to grab his brace, with Charlie Brown having rounded out Chelsea’s rout 20 minutes from time. Joe Hugill did manage to pull one back for United with 84 minutes on the clock, but, for obvious reasons, it proved little more than a consolation on an evening to forget for the Reds. For Chelsea, on the other hand, today’s action highlighted once again just how special some of the talent currently making its way through the club’s youth ranks truly is. A number of the Blues’ starlets shone versus United, with 16-year-old Jude Soonsup-Bell’s remarkable goalscoring exploits having continued. The undisputed star of the show, though, was Tino Anjorin. 19-year-old attacking midfielder Anjorin has of course been part of Chelsea’s first-team setup on occasion this season, and was even handed his Champions League bow by Frank Lampard earlier this month. At Kingsmeadow on Friday, meanwhile, the English youth international once again showcased exactly why he has long been regarded as a potential star in the making. Along with bagging a double of his own, Anjorin also set up a pair of his side’s other goals, simply proving too much for Manchester United’s backline to deal with. Further senior opportunities appear inevitable based on his current form at youth level, with Frank Lampard no doubt already making plans based on the assumption that Anjorin will go on to establish himself as a regular fixture in Chelsea’s midfield down the line.
