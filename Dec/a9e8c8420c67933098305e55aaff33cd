Chelsea striker Timo Werner today provided an insight into the impression left on him by his new teammates in southwest London. Following months of rampant speculation surrounding his future, Werner of course finally made the move to Stamford Bridge this past June. On the back of another scintillating season in Germany, during which the versatile attacker racked up 34 goals and 10 assists across all competitions, Chelsea stumped up the required £47 million to activate Werner’s RB Leipzig release clause.

Somewhat concerningly, however, none of Werner’s goals have come since the middle of November. In fact, the former Leipzig man is currently in the midst of an 8-game goalless run, during which he has often looked completely off the pace. In turn, speaking during an interview with Sky Deutschland earlier today, Werner was drawn on his recent struggles. And the gifted attacker went on to admit that adapting to the physical demands of English football has proven ‘tougher’ than he foresaw: “The Premier League is a little bit different to my old league. It’s tougher than I thought. The contact here is harder than in Germany, it’s what I expected but not like this.” <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1291457331-1024x683.jpg" alt="Timo Werner names the Chelsea star who has impressed him most since summer arrival"/> WOLVERHAMPTON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Timo Werner of Chelsea runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Chelsea at Molineux on December 15, 2020 in Wolverhampton, England.

A particular emphasis was placed on which member of Frank Lampard’s squad has thus far impressed him most, with Werner having been in no two minds regarding his choice. The Blues star opted for N’Golo Kante, hailing the all-action midfielder as ‘special’: ‘We have so many good players.’ ‘But one is special, even if many know how good he is: N’Golo Kanté stands out in real life.’ ‘What he runs away from the ball and what kind of competitor he is in training – unbelievable.’ ‘If you think he can’t get the ball, then he’ll steal it from behind you. This is impressive.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
