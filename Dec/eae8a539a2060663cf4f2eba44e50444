Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided an update on the fitness of Thomas Partey, amid claims that the midfielder is in fact not at all close to a return to the pitch. The Gunners of course returned to Premier League action on Sunday, in a meeting with Wolves at the Emirates. Arsenal headed into proceedings desperate for all 3 points, having slipped to a lowly 14th in the English top-flight table ahead of kick-off. This came with the capital outfit’s only win across their last 5 in the league having come at Old Trafford at the beginning of the month. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="Fears Thomas Partey could be out until new year as Arteta confirms Arsenal star’s injury is worse than first thought"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

First-half trikes from Pedro Neto and Daniel Podence, either side of a Gabriel Magalhaes header, eventually proved enough for Wolves to snag all 3 points away from their hosts, plunging Arsenal into borderline crisis in the process.

The pairing of Granit Xhaka and Dani Ceballos, who so often impressed over the latter weeks of last season, looked absolutely lost versus Wolves, unable to provide the type of control which is so key to nullifying the threat of Nuno Espirito Santo’s men. Such woes, it is safe to assume, would have been greatly aided by the presence of Thomas Partey, who last night missed his 3rd-straight outing for the Gunners. Deadline day addition Partey was forced off at half-time of the Gunners’ 3-0 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa prior to the international break, and has not featured for club or country since. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-1-1024x699.jpg" alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 17: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal talks to Thomas Partey of Arsenal before making his debut during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on October 17, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Speaking on the back of his side’s latest disappointing display, the Arsenal boss admitted: ‘He had an injury very early in the game [against Aston Villa], he wanted to continue the second-half.’ ‘We knew it was a significant injury. He’s done very well and he’s working very hard, he wants to be available.’ ‘Hopefully we can get him back soon but it’s an area we need to be careful and we need to be protective with the player.’ ‘I don’t think he will be with us in the next few games.’ Worryingly, Arteta’s update on Partey arrived hot on the heels of claims across social media that the former Atletico Madrid man looks set to be sidelined for a further 4 weeks, or potentially even into the new year: Thomas Partey will not return until the new year due to injury [@DarrenArsenal1]. pic.twitter.com/d1W9g6uH2C — AFTV (@AFTVMedia) November 30, 2020 I said 6 weeks and its been 2 already with 4 more to go.
