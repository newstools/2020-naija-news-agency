Premier League giants Arsenal have this evening provided fitness updates on a number of the club’s star performers. Mikel Arteta’s men are of course still riding high on the back of a potentially season-altering result over the weekend. The Gunners welcomed capital rivals Chelsea to the Emirates on Saturday, for a Premier League clash. Arsenal headed into proceedings amid a frankly disastrous string of results, which had seen the north Londoners slip to a lowly 15th in the English top-flight table. When all was said and done 48 hours ago, however, Arteta’s outfit stepped up in the face of adversity, to eventually emerge on the right side of a 3-1 scoreline. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture16-1-1024x707.jpg" alt="LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 26: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his team&#039;s third goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on December 26, 2020 in London, England.

And this will be swiftly followed by yet another matchup with an outfit battling relegation at the weekend, when the Gunners visit West Brom. As such, Mikel Arteta and co. will likely be quietly confident in their chances of securing a couple of positive results over the week ahead. As outlined above, however, one individual whom the Spaniard will be forced to do without versus both Brighton and West Brom is Gabriel Magalhaes. Brazilian stopper Gabriel was forced to sit out Arsenal’s win over Chelsea on Saturday, after coming into close contact with an individual who subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 during the festive period. And, during today’s latest round of testing at the Emirates, the summer arrival in north London also returned a positive result. As per an official post across the club’s social media platforms a short time ago: Gabriel Has tested positive for COVID-19 and is isolating according to UK Government and Premier League protocols. We will continue to monitor and support Gabriel, and we are hoping he will be available again after our next two matches. Elsewhere, both David Luiz and Willian, who also sat out their side’s meeting with their former club at the weekend, are on the recovery trail. Neither, though, will link back up with Mikel Arteta’s squad until Thursday, ruling the Brazilian duo out of contention versus Brighton: David LuizSince feeling unwell, David has returned to outside training and is due to re-join the full squad on Thursday (31 December). WillianSince feeling unwell, Willian has returned to outside training and is due to re-join the full squad on Thursday (31 December). Willian’s absence in particular is likely to spell good news for Arsenal’s youthful attacking contingent, with at least two of Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith-Rowe in line to maintain their spots in the Gunners’ starting XI on Tuesday.
