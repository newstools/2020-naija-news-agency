The Best FIFA awards 2020 took place on Thursday evening. Due to Covid-19, there would be no in-person attendance for this year’s award. But with the Ballon d’Or not taking place this year, The Best awards were the most high-profile football ceremony of 2020. The most high-profile accolade up for grabs on the evening was The Best FIFA Men’s Player award. The award was first handed out in 2016, to then Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese then picked it up again the following year with Luka Modric and current holder Lionel Messi then landing the trophy in 2018 and 2019. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230019084-1024x683.jpg" alt="Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski pips Barcelona’s Messi to The Best Men’s Player award"/> BARCELONA, SPAIN – DECEMBER 08: (BILD ZEITUNG OUT) Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus FC and Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona look on during the UEFA Champions League Group G stage match between FC Barcelona and Juventus at Camp Nou on December 8, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.

Lionel Messi, though Barca as a squad had underwhelmed, had a fantastic 2020. Last season, for example, saw the Argentine finish as both the top-scorer and top-assister in La Liga with 25 goals and a staggering 21 assists. Ronaldo would help Juventus to yet another league title, notching 31 goals in the process. As for Lewandowski, he, of course, played a huge role in Bayern Munich clinching the quadruple – which included hammerings of Barcelona and Chelsea on route to a Champions League final victory over PSG. And on Thursday evening, it was revealed that Lewandowski had beaten off some stiff competition to earn his first-ever The Best Men’s Player award: He’s done it! @lewy_official overcomes two of the greatest players in history to become #TheBest FIFA Men’s Player for the first time! @FCBayern | @LaczyNasPilka  pic.twitter.com/TK34hTXcsS — FIFA.com (@FIFAcom) December 17, 2020 To find out the rest of the evening’s high-profile award winners, check out the piece below: Liverpool’s Klopp named The Best Men’s Coach Tottenham’s Son wins 2020 Puskas award https://t.co/7oVreE9SdR — 101 Great Goals (@101greatgoals) December 17, 2020 See also: Southampton vs Manchester City betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Sheffield United vs Manchester United betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
