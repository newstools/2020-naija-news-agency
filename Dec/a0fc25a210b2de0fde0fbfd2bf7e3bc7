Real Madrid have turned around their La Liga form and look to be on a roll as they chase down title and city rivals Atletico Madrid. Their most recent victory came in a 2-0 win over Granada. However, Zinedine Zidane paid a serious price during the victory with Brazilian winger Rodrygo being taking off with a serious injury in the first half. The 19-year-old had to be stretchered from the field and will be a great concern to Zidane as he looks to continue to press ahead with his league and European commitments. Real Madrid have now confirmed the injury and provided a statement to supporters: ‘After the tests carried out on our player Rodrygo by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he was diagnosed with a muscle injury affecting the tendon in the right biceps femoris.’ Regarding the length of time which Real Madrid will be without the Brazilian wide man, Spanish media have reported it could be as many as 4 to 6-weeks. This could potentially see Rodrygo miss up to 6 matches including the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Club. Fortunately for Zidane, the club have plenty of alternatives to field instead of the Brazilian including his compatriot Vinicius Junior. Spanish wingers Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio are available and the talismanic figure of Eden hazard will be present once he too returns to full fitness. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-1127967395-1024x727.jpg" alt="Real Madrid confirm Rodrygo muscle injury and possible 4-6 week absence / Marco Asensio chased by Liverpool and French champions"/> BARCELONA, SPAIN – FEBRUARY 06: Vinicius Jr of Real Madrid gestures during the Copa del Rey Semi Final match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid at Nou Camp on February 06, 2019 in Barcelona, Spain.

He arrived from Mallorca before his 20th birthday and was sent on loan to Espanyol in Catalonia where he starred. Returning to Los Blancos, Asensio broke into the first team and scored some important goals in both La Liga and the Champions League. However, recently the Spaniard has struggled for consistent form and game time. The departure of Cristiano Ronaldo opened the door to allow Asensio more opportunities but Real Madrid invested heavily in young attacking wide players such as the aforementioned Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo. The arrival of Eden Hazard also complicated matters for Asensio and the Spaniard has been limited since. A serious knee injury meant that he missed nearly the entirety of the 2019/20 campaign and returned after the initial lockdown period. He scored on his return and once again renewed faith was established. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-832835620-1024x683.jpg" alt="Real Madrid confirm Rodrygo muscle injury and possible 4-6 week absence / Marco Asensio chased by Liverpool and French champions"/> MADRID, SPAIN – AUGUST 16: Marco Asensio of Real Madrid CF celebrates scoring their opening goal during the Supercopa de Espana Final 2nd Leg match between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on August 16, 2017 in Madrid, Spain.

Mohamed Salah has said he is open to the possibility of one day playing for Barcelona or even Real Madrid themselves. PSG face the constant threat of losing one of their key wingers in Mbappe and Neymar with Madrid hold a long-term interest in the Frenchman. With Real Madrid being linked with a move for Salah or Mbappe, it is is unsurprising to see Asensio linked with a move in the other direction. With the impact of the coronavirus pandemic many clubs face financial difficulties and therefore any swap deals available to lighten any burden on a possible sale will likely be explored. It is unlikely any move for Asensio would materialize in January but a summer window departure seemingly could happen.
