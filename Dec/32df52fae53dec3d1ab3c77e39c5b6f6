Lyon star Houssem Aouar this afternoon provided a brief insight into his current mindset, as links to Premier League giants Arsenal ramp up once more. The major talking point at the Emirates throughout the latest transfer window of course surrounded the club’s chase of reinforcements in the middle of the park. Over the course of the summer, a whole host of midfield stars were linked with a move to north London. Chief among these, over lengthy stretches, were Lyon’s Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid standout Thomas Partey. In the end, having proven frustrated in their pursuit of the former, Arsenal opted to bring in Ghanaian international Partey, to add some much-needed presence to Mikel Arteta’s midfield ranks. And the 27-year-old certainly didn’t taken long in making his presence felt, bagging Man of the Match honours in his full Gunners debut versus Rapid Wien, before driving his new side to a long overdue win at Old Trafford last month. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg" alt="Houssem Aouar speaks out over future amid claims Mikel Arteta wants Lyon star as ‘core’ of Arsenal team"/> Arsenal’s Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey (L) vies with Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba (R) during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on November 1, 2020.

Recent weeks have seen the complete lack of a creative spark at Mikel Arteta’s disposal (as Mesut Ozil remains frozen out) widely highlighted, with a midfielder capable of both setting up teammates and finding the back of the net himself expected to be next on the Gunners’ wishlist. The player most persistently tipped to fill this role ahead of the opening of the January window, up until recently, came in the form of Red Bull Salzburg sensation Dominik Szoboszlai. This was, however, until confirmation was forthcoming earlier this week that the Hungarian has opted to join RB Leipzig: #RBLeipzig are delighted to announce the signing of Dominik #Szoboszlai!

The Frenchman has endured an indifferent opening to the campaign with Lyon, with the financial crisis facing Ligue 1’s clubs following the collapse of the division’s TV rights deal representing a boost for any foreign clubs eyeing up stars plying their trade in the French top-flight. And, if the latest word stemming from the English media this evening is to be believed, then Arsenal could well prove to be one such side. As per a report from reliable Twitter outlet The AFC Bell, the Gunners remain in contact with Aouar’s camp. This comes amid suggestions that Mikel Arteta views the 22-year-old as the ideal source of creativity missing from his side’s ranks, with the Spaniard intent on building his team around the Lyon man: #جرس_أرسنال يتفهم أن أرسنال لازال على وصال مع معسكر حسام عوار. النادي أرسل إشارات واضحة للاعب و أسرته أن أرتيتا يعتزم جعل عوار نواة الفريق النادي يرى خصائص حسام مفتاح التحول لرسم تكتيكي هجومي أكثر فاعلية pic.twitter.com/cZITuB2ymu — TheAFCBell (@TheAFCBeII) December 18, 2020 Interestingly, the latest claims surrounding Arsenal’s pursuit of Aouar come on the same day that the Frenchman has been drawn on his future at the Groupama Stadium. Speaking to the media ahead of Lyon’s meeting with Nice on Saturday night, Aouar was questioned on his plans moving forward, as well as the possibility of a January exit. The midfielder, though, was keen to shift focus back to matters with his current club, assuring that he remains ‘motivated to bring the most’ he can to Rudi Garcia’s line-up: ‘Honestly, I am not looking at the transfer window. I am here, I try to improve on a personal level, I will try to have the best of seasons. We don’t know what could happen tomorrow, but I’m very motivated to bring the most to the team.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
