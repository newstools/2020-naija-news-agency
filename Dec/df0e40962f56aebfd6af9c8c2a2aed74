His music is unmistakably African, but fits seamlessly into today's pop music culture. 'African Giant' contains a challenging mix of Rap, RnB, Reggae and African pop music and reminds at times of the also Nigerian great Fela Kuti. The latter is not surprising. His grandfather was Kuti's manager. From an early age, Burna Boy was a musical omnivore. Through his father he heard dancehall and American RnB at school. From Nigeria he moved to London. This diversity of influences can be heard on the album 'African Giant', with guest appearances by many greats from the various music styles from which he draws. Each time Burna Boy knows how to bring these together skillfully, on various African grooves, into a coherent whole. The album includes guest appearances by Angélique Kidjo in duet with Damian Marley, the English young soul star Jorja Smith, the American YG and Future. Linguistically this album is also a mix, with guest appearances in English, while Burna Boy himself mainly sings in Pidgin, Yoruba and Igbo on this album. Despite the fact that it is a wonderfully groovy album, the themes addressed are deep. That also fits in the tradition of Kuti: Burna tackles corruption and other abuses in society. <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/michelle-on-burna-594x420.png"/> The post Burna Boy Becomes First Naija Artiste to Win The Edison Award With 'African Giant' Album appeared first on Most Trusted Voice in Music & Afrobeats from Nigeria & Africa | Notjustok.
