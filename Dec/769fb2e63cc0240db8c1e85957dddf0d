A nightmare 90 minutes for Manchester United in Germany this evening saw the Red Devils sent packing from the Champions League in embarrassing fashion. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men made the trip to the Red Bull Arena a short time ago, for a crunch showdown with RB Leipzig. Ahead of kick-off, the Group H table hung completely in the balance, with all of United, Leipzig and PSG locked in top spot with 9 points apiece. PSG of course entered the evening as favourites to advance to the last-16, with last season’s finalists having played host to bottom of the table Istanbul Basaksehir. Manchester United, meanwhile, needed only avoid defeat in Germany, to ensure their safe passage to the knockout rounds. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg" alt="Solskjaer’s luck finally runs out as ‘secret agent’ Angelino sends Man United packing to the Europa League"/> Manchester United’s English Forward Marcus Rashford (R) celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Europa League Group H first-leg football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Manchester United at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on October 20, 2020.

The latest in a string of remarkable comebacks, at one point, looked very much on for the Reds. However, upon the final-whistle sounding, it was Julian Nageslmann’s hosts who emerged on the right side of a 3-2 result. A wild opening to proceedings saw Leipzig take a 2-0 lead inside the first 15 minutes, as Manchester City loanee Angelino first rifled home a superb finish from the left, before teeing up Amadou Haidara for an equally impressive 2nd: Wow… RB Leipzig took the lead inside two minutes against Man Utd Angelino, a left-back on loan from Man City, bags his seventh goal of the season! pic.twitter.com/LFFyfk4x3E — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 8, 2020 In turn, when Justin Kluivert added a 3rd for the home side 20 minutes from time, the 3 points looked all but secured: This is a nightmare for Man Utd 59 seconds after Bruno Fernandes clatters the bar, RB Leipzig go up the other end and compile the misery with a third goal… And it’s not pretty  pic.twitter.com/bxAHsTyu8i — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 8, 2020 Manchester United, though, as proven week after week of late, simply can’t be counted out when behind, particularly on the road. As such, when Bruno Fernandes’ 80th-minute penalty was followed just two minutes later by a headed Paul Pogba finish from a corner, it looked almost written in the stars that the Manchester giants were primed for another staggering come-from-behind result: Wouldn’t you know it, Paul Pogba scores for Man Utd! Two goals in no time at all and suddenly there’s a lifeline… pic.twitter.com/dNeHwTyxAs — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) December 8, 2020 The final 10 minutes, though, despite what appeared to be the best efforts of Leipzig to throw away their advantage, somehow failed to produce a goal. The Germans, in turn, march on to the Champions League’s last-16, no doubt keen to kick on towards the semi-final berth secured in last season’s competition. For Manchester United, on the other hand, the inquest now begins. It of course must be remembered that the Red Devils, at one point, boasted a 6-point haul from 2 games played in Group H. Bafflingly, Solskjaer’s men, from this position, managed to fall to a trio of defeats across their last 4 outings, to slip out of European football’s premiere competition in nothing short of embarrassing fashion. Recent weeks, as outlined above, have of course seen United’s staggering comeback wins take centre stage in the English media. The Manchester powerhouse, in each of their last 3 domestic outings away from home, fell behind, before roaring back to bag all 3 points. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1288438573-1024x683.jpg" alt="Solskjaer’s luck finally runs out as ‘secret agent’ Angelino sends Man United packing to the Europa League"/> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: Edinson Cavani of Manchester United celebrates after he heads in and scores a goal to make it 3-2 during the Premier League match between Southampton and Manchester United at St Mary’s Stadium on November 29, 2020 in Southampton, England.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been routinely outmanaged over recent weeks, looking tactically inept when it comes to both game-plan and balance. The Norwegian, though, has been bailed out by individual brilliance, on the part of the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood. It therefore does not feel like too much of a stretch to suggest that, tonight, Solskjaer’s luck simply ran out. The one final touch to scrape past an outfit whom Reds sides of years gone by would have been expected to make short work of was, at the Red Bull Arena, just not forthcoming. Why was such a touch needed? Because Solskjaer set his side up in a manner which saw them absolutely dominated for lengthy stretches, leading to a deserved 3-goal deficit which simply proved too much to overcome. 3 – Man Utd have conceded 3+ goals in consecutive Champions League games for the first time since April 2003 (Both v Real Madrid). Whimper. pic.twitter.com/I2t38Iqjsy — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 8, 2020 The problems at Old Trafford are of course many as things stand, with Paul Pogba’s future and the form of the likes of David de Gea and Harry Maguire just some of the most noteworthy. Solskjaer, though, must take on the blame for tonight’s result, having once again proven himself overly dependent on moments of individual magic, and lacking in the kind of managerial talents deserving of a club the size of Manchester United.
