Tanganga, 21, is a product of Spurs’ youth system, and was handed his senior debut last season. The Englishman, who is a centre-back by trade, but also more than capable of lining out on the left and right-hand side of defence, was most certainly thrown in at the deep end by Jose Mourinho. Tanganga would make his first-team debut under the Portuguese tactician vs Liverpool in January. Spurs lost that clash 1-0, but Tanganga impressed throughout, despite being deployed in something of an unnatural role. He has since gone on to feature 13 more times for the Lilywhites’ senior side, including on three occasions this term. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1165588830-1024x718.jpg" alt="Tottenham’s Japhet Tanganga explains Jose Mourinho’s influence on him"/> MUNICH, GERMANY – JULY 31: Japhet Manzambi Tanganga of Tottenham controls the ball during the Audi cup 2019 final match between Tottenham Hotspur and Bayern Muenchen at Allianz Arena on July 31, 2019 in Munich, Germany.

The Portuguese would hand Tanganga his senior debut in the aforementioned clash with Liverpool. The defender has also been handed a new Spurs deal whilst under Mourinho’s guidance, And when asked to reflect on Mourinho’s influence on his early career in a recent interview, the stopper was full of praise for his boss: “He has really helped me understand the game in a different perspective. He has helped me in so many ways, learning to defend better, manage the game better and so many aspects I felt I really needed to take that next step in my career. “He has done a lot for me. He looks after me, asks how I feel, gives me tips to do this, encourages me when I’m doing well, tells me when I’m not doing well. He’s exactly what players want and for me he has been very helpful. “What helps the most? His knowledge of the game, his detail into how he looks at opposition. He makes it a lot easier for us going into a game knowing our opposition. It’s so helpful, for example, going into a game against Chelsea and you know he’ll give you all the tools and guidance to nullify Werner’s pace and make sure you stop him at source. His detail is amazing, that’s what I’d take from him.” Exclusive interview with Japhet Tanganga:– Proving Mourinho is the best manager for young players– Taking influence from Sergio Ramos– Ending the trophy drought https://t.co/hcyrWa8mOd — James Benge (@jamesbenge) December 10, 2020 See also: Manchester United vs Manchester City betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Newcastle vs West Brom betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
