Arsenal avoided their 5th straight home loss in a row after a 1-1 draw with Southampton. Arsenal went behind to a Theo Walcott opener and the former Gunner made no attempt to temper his celebration upon returning to his former club. However Arsenal came back, Bukayo Saka seemed to carry the weight of the club on his shoulders as he strode towards the Saints box. The ball eventually being played through to Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang who slotted the equaliser. But just as the hope of a winner began to grow, another red card offense, this time for Gabriel saw Arsenal pegged back in their own half but held on for the draw. Speaking after the game, Arteta said that he felt the initial yellow card for Gabriel, which in the end proved key, was harsh. “There were many incidents before that where the referee didn’t give any yellow cards for blocking free-kicks, for kicking the ball out and we got it. You have to be a little stable on that understand the game and the tension,” said the Spaniard. Another RED CARD for @Arsenal The Gunners are down to 10 men after Gabriel is shown a second yellow…#PLonPrime #ARSSOU pic.twitter.com/ll6Q2UKBA8 — Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 16, 2020 “It’s very difficult to compete in this league when you play as well for such a long period with ten men. And we were struggling for the result which makes it even more complicated.” “But I think that the boys stood up through it and they showed a lot of character and again a lot of resilience and they never gave up. After 1-0 I was worried because after this moment you can start to see players tiring and it didn’t really help.” Arsenal managed to even create a chance at the end with Rob Holding have a header hit the bar. It is clear Arsenal need a break and it just seems to be eluding them at present. Consistent losses are going to have no chance of turning around the environment at the Arsenal. The point against a high-flying Southampton side will however have a mental boost of some description. Gunners fans may look at it on paper still as a big disappointment but considering the context, it is a small element of progress. Arteta was asked on whether the draw could kick start their season, the 38-year-old coach was optimistic that it could. “Yeah I agree yes because at the end if we lose the game again that would be a difficult one to take. The players showed what we expect them to do. Some will be with more or less quality but at least the work is there,” he said. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture3-1024x661.jpg" alt="LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 16: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal celebrates with teammate Rob Holding after scoring their team&#039;s first goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Southampton at Emirates Stadium on December 16, 2020 in London, England.
