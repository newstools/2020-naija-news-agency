An update on the fitness of Chelsea star Reece James has been forthcoming online on Sunday evening. The major talking point surrounding Frank Lampard’s squad this weekend of course centered on James. This came on the back of the revelation that the right-back, who has played an integral role in the Blues’ backline to this point in the campaign, has been dealing with a knee issue for some time now. This was made all the worse during the week, when a challenge from Daniel Podence during Chelsea’s defeat to Wolves left James in considerable discomfort. In turn, the English international was forced to undergo a scan on Saturday, to gain a better understanding of the problem. And, as revealed by the reliable Simon Johnson of The Athletic, the results of this scan, in turn, would see it decided whether or not James required surgical intervention. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272484904-1024x730.jpg" alt="Reece James update: Surgery avoided but Chelsea star set for spell on sidelines"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: Reece James of Chelsea scores his sides second goal during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at American Express Community Stadium on September 14, 2020 in Brighton, England.

And it will no doubt come as a major relief to not only Chelsea’s fans, but also Frank Lampard. Johnson is once again the source of the news, with the Blues reporter having confirmed that James, as things stand, will not be forced under the knife. The results of the stopper’s scan revealed that his problem is not a serious one, with surgery only set to be required if James’ knee continues to get worse as time passes. Nevertheless, though, the 21-year-old is expected to sit out Chelsea’s upcoming run of fixtures, starting with the club’s derby meeting with West Ham on Monday night.
