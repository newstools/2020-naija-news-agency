An insight into the mindset of Liverpool star Georginio Wijnaldum has been forthcoming online this evening, amid increasing uncertainty surrounding his Anfield future. Dutch international Wijnaldum has been on the books of Liverpool since the summer of 2016. And, despite his arrival from Premier League rivals Newcastle having initially gone somewhat under the radar, the 30-year-old has gone on to establish himself as an absolutely integral member of Jurgen Klopp’s midfield over the years since. Wijnaldum has started no less than 27 league games in each of his 4 seasons at Anfield, including all but three of the Reds’ league fixtures en route to English top-flight glory in 2019/20. The Feyenoord youth product’s brace in Liverpool’s stunning Champions League semi-final comeback versus Barcelona last year, meanwhile, saw Wijnaldum etch his name indellibly into club folklore. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1147626567-1024x683.jpg" alt="The latest on Gini Wijnaldum’s Liverpool future as Reds await contract response"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – MAY 07: Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal with Trent Alexander-Arnold during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final second leg match between Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield on May 07, 2019 in Liverpool, England.

This comes with the all-action midfielder’s contract at Anfield due to expire next summer, and new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman known to have been keen on the services of his fellow countryman during the summer: Gini Wijnaldum remains Ronald Koeman’s first choice target for Barcelona but a deal with Liverpool is “complicated”. [@FabrizioRomano] — Anfield Edition (@AnfieldEdition) September 14, 2020 Recent reports, meanwhile, have gone as far as to suggest that Liverpool are essentially ‘resigned’ to the fact that Wijnaldum will indeed be moving on in 2021. And, as outlined above, an update surrounding the situation has, on Sunday, been forthcoming. The news comes courtesy of reliable transfer insider Fabrizio Romano. Wijnaldum, who played the full 90 minutes as Klopp’s Reds were held to a surprise 1-1 draw by West Brom this evening, is said to be continuing to mull over his options. This comes with Liverpool having tabled a fresh contract offer to their midfield star several weeks ago. Significantly, it is also added that, before any potential negotiations are opened with other clubs regarding a free agent exit, Wijnaldum will first inform those in a position of power at Anfield of his definitive decision: Liverpool made a new contract offer to Wijnaldum few weeks ago. The proposal has not been accepted yet. Gini wants to reflect. And to pay rispect to the club, he will give priority and communicate his decision to #LFC before negotiating with other clubs as a free agent. — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) December 27, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
