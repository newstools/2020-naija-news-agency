Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has moved to shoot down any and all criticism of Kai Havertz, as the 21-year-old continues to work through his settling-in period in the English capital. Gifted starlet Havertz of course came as one of a number of big-money arrivals at Stamford Bridge this past summer. Just days after all of Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr put pen-to-paper on terms with Chelsea, the Blues thrashed out a deal with Bayer Leverkusen, to coax the German international to southwest London. He’s here! Welcome to Chelsea, @KaiHavertz29! #HiKai — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) September 4, 2020 Havertz, to this point, has gone on to enjoy a solid if unspectacular opening to the campaign. After initially struggling to come to terms with the step up in physicality posed by the Premier League, the 21-year-old began to find his feet as the weeks progressed, impressing versus the likes of Krasnodar and Barnsley, the latter of whom he managed a hat-trick against. Just when the midfield talent appeared to be coming into his own, however, a bout of Covid-19 saw his progress halted. In turn, with the likes of fellow summer additions Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva having dazzled across the same stretch, questions – somewhat unfairly – began to be asked of Havertz. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg" alt="‘A huge player for Chelsea’ – Frank Lampard hits back at early Havertz critics"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: Kai Havertz of Chelsea runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at American Express Community Stadium on September 14, 2020 in Brighton, England.

Speaking ahead of his side’s upcoming Champions League meeting with Krasnodar, the Blues boss was drawn on Havertz’s hit-and-miss start to life at Stamford Bridge. Lampard, though, was quick to defend the German from his detractors, first providing an insight into Havertz’s struggles with Covid: ‘He’s fitting in really well. He had really strong symptoms of Covid, he was very ill and struggling for quite a while. Some of the players have had it like that, some have been symptom free so we had to factor that in and that’s why it took two or so weeks before he was starting again once he returned from Covid.’ ‘Going into when he fell ill, his form was fantastic and he was playing some really good stuff.’ ‘He was playing in the No.8 role, the advanced midfield role, and I was delighted for him because you could see he was enjoying it and then obviously Covid cut that short.’ The Chelsea boss also went on to talk up his young midfield star’s talents, revealing the belief that Havertz will soon go on to play a major role on football’s world stage: ‘Long-term, I’ve got absolutely no worries about Kai – in fact it’s the opposite. I know he’s going to be a huge player for this football club, in the Premier League. He has all the attributes, all the personality, all the attitude and he’s going to be an absolutely top-class player for me, in the Premier League and in the world. That’s how highly I rate him.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
