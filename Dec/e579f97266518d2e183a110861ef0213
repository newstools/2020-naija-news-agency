This weekend’s most high-profile Premier League ties will see Tottenham and Arsenal face off in the first north London derby of the season. The two outfits head into the highly-anticipated clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in very contrasting form. Spurs will begin the weekend sitting pretty atop of the Premier League table boasting the best defence and second-best attack in the division. Arsenal, on the other hand, are sitting down in a lowly 14th place having already lost five of their 10 league ties this season. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276970062-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho believes Tottenham’s Harry Kane will be fit to face Arsenal this weekend"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 27: Jose Mourinho, Manager of Tottenham Hotspur reacts during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on September 27, 2020 in London, England.

Kane missed Tottenham’s 3-3 draw with LASK on Thursday evening, with the Portuguese stating previously he was unsure if their star strike would be fit for the weekend’s game with Arsenal. Of course, Kane missing out on such a big game would no doubt be a huge blow to Spurs. Kane has been in immense form this campaign, netting a staggering seven goals and nine assists in the Premier League for the Lilywhites. His link-up play with Heung-min Son has also been superb and a big reason why Spurs are top of the table. However, following their latest Europa League tie, Mourinho has moved to provide an update on Kane, and it is a positive one from a Spurs perspective. When speaking about the striker in his post-LASK presser, Mourinho said the following: “I believe [Harry Kane] is going to be fit. I’m not sure. He’s having treatment but I could be doing some bluff and pretend he’s in trouble, but he’s not and I think he’ll play [against Arsenal].” Quotes via football.london.
