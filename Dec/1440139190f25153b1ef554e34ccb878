The latest word stemming from the European media on Friday suggests that Paul Pogba is putting serious pressure on agent Mino Raiola to find him a new club. Despite Manchester United having been ousted from the Champions League in devastating fashion by RB Leipzig earlier this week, the majority of the media chatter surrounding ongoings at Old Trafford over the days since has in fact not surrounded the club’s struggles on the pitch. Instead, it has centered on the future of star midfielder Paul Pogba. This of course comes after Mino Raiola, the Frenchman’s representative, dropped the most untimely of bombshells regarding his client, on the eve of United’s crunch European outing. Speaking in an interview with Italian outlet Tuttosport, Raiola explained: ‘I can say that it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.’ ‘Paul is unhappy with Man United as he is no longer able to express himself in the way that he would like and as he is expected to. Paul needs a new team, a change of air. He is under contract for the next 18 months and it will expire in the summer of 2022.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1229960439.jpg" alt="January transfer incoming?

Nevertheless, it now appears all but certain that the 27-year-old’s time in Manchester is set to come to an imminent end, with the only real remaining question surrounding where exactly Pogba is set to end up. Real Madrid and Juventus have of course long been credited with an interest, with the admission of Bianconeri sporting director Fabio Paratici that the club still ‘love’ their former midfield standout having only seen links to the Serie A champions ramp up over the days since. And, as outlined above, if the latest speculation stemming from the European media this evening is to be believed, then a transfer coming to fruition as early as next month cannot be ruled out. As revealed by the reliable Christian Falk of German outlet SportBILD, Pogba is pressuring Mino Raiola to find him a new club as soon as possible. In fact, so desperate is the Frenchman to move on, that it is suggested he will consider parting with his long-time agent, if an exit from Old Trafford is not agreed upon in the very near future: The TRUE  background why Mino Raiola is now speaking publicly in an interview about the farewell of @paulpogba from @ManUtd.
