Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has this evening spoken out over the potential participation of attackers Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling in his side’s meeting with Fulham. The Sky Blues are set to welcome Scott Parker’s men to the Etihad tomorrow, for their latest Premier League outing. City will head into proceedings on the back of a morale-boosting result last time out, when they bounced back from defeat at Tottenham with a comprehensive 5-0 drubbing of Burnley. This leaves the Manchester giants, despite an altogether unimpressive opening to the campaign, just 3 points adrift of 4th-placed Leicester, with a game in hand. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183550347-1024x702.jpg" alt="Pep Guardiola reveals latest on Man City pair Aguero &amp; Sterling"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 26: Pep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City looks on prior to the Premier League match between Manchester City and Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium on October 26, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

After failing to secure a win across any of their first 6 Premier League outings of the season, Fulham went on to bag 6 points from an available 12 in November. Their most recent result proved particularly impressive, with the Cottagers having downed Leicester by 2 goals to 1 at the King Power Stadium last weekend. As such, though City will of course head into tomorrow afternoon’s clash as overwhelming favourites, the Citizens will no doubt remain wary of the threat posed by an improving Fulham. And, ahead of his side’s meeting with the capital outfit, Pep Guardiola, on Friday, held his latest press conference. The Sky Blues boss was draw on a whole host of topics during the media exchange, though the most noteworthy takeaway came in the form of updates on both Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. Argentine hitman Aguero has of course struggled to regain full fitness after recently returning from a spell out of action, with the 32-year-old having not featured in either of City’s last two fixtures. And, as confirmed by Guardiola a short time ago, Aguero is also set to miss out versus Fulham: ‘No. He’s getting better, today part of the training. That is the good news that he’s already on the pitch with us. We’ll see [if he’s back soon].’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1142619241-1024x727.jpg" alt="Sergio Aguero"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – APRIL 14: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City warms up ahead of the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Manchester City at Selhurst Park on April 14, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

In turn, Guardiola was inevitably also drawn on Sterling’s potential participation on Saturday. The Spaniard, though, remained coy on the subject, instead opting to hail his star wide-man’s talents: ‘He is an incredibly important player for us. The season is long. His contribution this season was huge, it has been in the past and will be. We speak with the players every day. I am on the pitch with them.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
