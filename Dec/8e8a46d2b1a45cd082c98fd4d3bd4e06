Big Brother Naija 2019 stars, Khafi Kareem and Gedoni Ekpata are officially married. Khafi, who confirmed her court wedding to BellaNaija, shared photos of herself and her husband after making it official at the Ikoyi Marriage Registry on, Thursday, September 24, 2020.

If this year taught us anything it was to take nothing for granted and each day is a gift. We weren’t able to have friends and family there apart from our witnesses but we know that by Gods grace we will be able to celebrate with our loved ones and family once the pandemic is over. “It’s simple when it’s right”. We didn’t see anything stopping us so we went for it. My brother’s death also made us realise that life truly isn’t promised so we didn’t want to wait. We have always known we wanted to spend forever together so we just kept on thinking, why delay forever from starting? The morning routine was getting up, getting ready, doing #KhafiPrays as usual but to be honest it was the day after that was weirdest! We woke up with the strongest and yet smallest cuffs in the world on our fingers . We woke up expecting and looking forward to “the married life” changes. Nothing physically change, we were the same people just that our hearts became one officially, as they had always been from the day we met. It feels like we had been married since the first day we met. Just without the official ceremonies. Excitement, fear of the unknown (good fear though), happiness. Just a big bowl of mixed feelings. I also just feel so relieved. Like this is my final bus stop. I always wondered who I would end up with and I remember praying about my future husband and I just feel wowed and grateful to God that my answer to prayer is here. Getting ready during KhafiPrays was so much fun. The Khafinated Prayer Warriors have been my family through every up and down and whilst we didn’t want to share publicly just yet that we were getting married, I just had to have them as part of my day. We prayed we laughed, we sang and it was just fun!! Arriving at my outfits was courtesy of the amazing Tolu Bally and Swanky Jerry, I just truly trusted them and my whole glam team to make me look beautiful and that is exactly what they did!! Looking forward to a life of growth, expansion, learning, positive changes, happiness, twin babies, and more. God talks so much about two heads being better than one and I’m ready for us to put that in action!! It is just an amazing thing to know you have someone who you are doing life with and I’m ready for whatever life may throw at us Credits: Styled by “The force” @swankyjerryGroom’s fit: @gedonibygedoniBride’s fit: @2207bytballyVenue: @thefivepalmDecorator: @ivie_craftsMUA: @t.alamodebeautyPhotographed by: @ahamiblemePlanners @2706eventsHair: @bernardsmiless We’ve known them from here… <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-3.jpeg"/> … to here <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1563320902-34_khad.jpeg"/> And here… <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bb-660x330-1.jpg"/> To celebrate their love today, we’re taking a look back at 6 times and moments that prepared us for today’s news.

It was no mistake when the Bible described humans as "treasures in earthen vessels", because I've found one in you – Precious, valuable, lovable and with a heart so pure. Your innocence is beautiful, your smile brightens my world and your entire personality? Simply delightful. I went into BBNaija for something I thought I wanted, and came out with someone I needed (a partner, a support system, a friend, a sister; everything I didn't even know I needed). On this special day; I just want to say I love you dearly @acupofkhafi and I cherish what we share. Love you longggggggggggg  @acupofkhafi A post shared by  GEDONI EKPATA (@gedoni) on Nov 2, 2019 at 10:53pm PDT <iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLChKEJONAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> <img src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/80904051_2539458782971690_8330511939856234496_n.jpg"/> Gedoni to Khafi Not just only because it’s Wednesday:Not just cause of the things I feel for you but cause of the things I do not feel for anyone else but you. ??:Not just for the many beautiful things you do and are to me; but cause of the many little things you do not even know you’re doing.Congratulations Love on the launch of your #acupofkhafimugs @thekhafishop????:#Ediye #WCW #supportsystem#everythingandmore#GodpikinI love you forever and a day more #mySunshine???
