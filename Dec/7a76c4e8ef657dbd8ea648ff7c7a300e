Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has this evening provided an update on the future of struggling goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. To say that the early months of the new campaign have proven of a testing nature for Kepa would of course be putting it lightly. Upon the season getting underway, the under-fire Spaniard, who endured a nightmare term in 2019/20, actually remained first-choice between the posts at Stamford Bridge. A series of disappointing displays, however, saw patience quickly wear thin, eventually resulting in Chelsea pushing through a deal for a new shot-stopper. Edouard Mendy was the man chosen to reinforce the goalkeeping ranks in southwest London, though Frank Lampard, upon the Senegalese’s arrival, was quick to assure that he had been brought in to provide competition to Kepa, rather than replace the 26-year-old. This, however, to the surprise of just about no-one, has since not proven to be the case. Mendy has gone on to quickly establish himself as the Pensioners’ undisputed no.1, playing a central role in the club’s stark improvement at the back of late. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg" alt="The latest on Kepa’s future as Chelsea shot-stopper prepares for Krasnodar start"/> Chelsea’s French goalkeeper Edouard Mendy plays during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on October 24, 2020.

As such, speaking ahead of his side’s latest fixture, tomorrow night, Frank Lampard was this evening drawn on both his backup shot-stopper’s potential participation, and future at the club. First, with the January window inching ever closer, the Chelsea boss was keen to assure that he is under absolutely ‘no pressure’ to move Kepa on: ‘No, there’s no pressure. The pressure, and I’m not saying this has been spoken about, is to win games.’ ‘I have to do the right thing game by game of course. And Mendy has made himself a permanent fixture at this point. Because the pressure to win games means I pick people in form: goalkeeper, striker, winger, whoever.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229125696-1024x683.jpg" alt="The latest on Kepa’s future as Chelsea shot-stopper prepares for Krasnodar start"/> Chelsea’s Danish defender Andreas Christensen (2nd R) reacts beside Southampton’s English striker Theo Walcott (R) and Chelsea’s Spanish goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga (2nd L) as Chelsea’s Moroccan midfielder Hakim Ziyech walks past after the English Premier League football match between Chelsea and Southampton at Stamford Bridge in London on October 17, 2020.
