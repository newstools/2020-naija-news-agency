Arsenal youngster William Saliba has taken to social media this evening, to send a clear message to the club regarding his current situation. Saliba’s Arsenal stint has of course proven somewhat bizarre to this point. The now-19-year-old was purchased from Saint-Etienne last summer, before being immediately loaned back to the Ligue 1 outfit, to gain further first-team experience. The general assumption, in turn, was that Saliba would return to the Emirates this year, ahead of playing a central role in Mikel Arteta’s first-team setup – the Gunners did, after all, splash out a reported £27 million on the youngster. And Saliba has, as expected, since returned to north London. However, he is yet to secure any sort of consistent game-time. In fact, the Frenchman has not been afforded a single appearance for Arsenal’s first-team to this point. Instead, Saliba has been restricted to outings with the club’s youth sides, having surprisingly been completely omitted from Mikel Arteta’s Europa League group stage squad. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg" alt="‘Locked up’ – Arsenal’s Saliba problem grows as stopper reaches out to sympathise with Matteo Guendouzi"/> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 13: William Saliba of Arsenal during a training session at London Colney on September 13, 2019 in St Albans, England.

In an exchange which has since gone viral, Saliba took to Instagram a short time ago, to congratulate fellow countryman and current Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi on netting his first goal for Hertha Berlin (showcased below).

And it was Saliba’s subsequent retort which looks likely to land the Frenchman in hot water with the coaching staff in north London: ‘Hahaha, I’m sending well wishes to the brother that was locked up like me’ Guendouzi, in turn, also appeared to aim a dig at his parent club, backing up Saliba in assuring: ‘We are together bro’ Willie Saliba said this on Guendouzi’s latest instagram post: Saliba: “”Pepe:”This is your problem, you comment on everything ”Saliba:”Hahaha, I’m sending well wishes to the brother that was locked up like me ”Guendouzi: “We are together bro ”. pic.twitter.com/WY2sOTvZ8T — Gilles  (@_Grimanditweets) December 12, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
