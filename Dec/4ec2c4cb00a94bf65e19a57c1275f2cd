Raul Jimenez’s terrible clash of heads with Arsenal’s David Luiz left the Mexican with a fractured skull. He was rushed to hospital and responded well to treatment. Wolves coach Nuno Espirito Santo was positive about the reaction the striker was having to treatment in light of the horrific incident. Nuno: “Jimenez is doing a scan now but he’s conscious, he’s OK (considering) the gravity of the problem, of course. “It’s serious, it was a bad moment for everybody. We are worried of course. “He speaks, he’s aware, now he has to do a proper assessment. He’s in good hands.” — Tim Spiers (@TimSpiers) November 29, 2020 More recent information has now come out from the Wolves doctor Matt Perry. BBC Reporter Simon Stone reported that Jimenez could be out of hospital by early next week. “Following Raul’s injury + subsequent surgery, he has been recovering well in hospital. We are delighted with reports from his specialist; he has made excellent progress. He should be ready to leave hospital by early next week,” said Perry. “Once home, he will be reunited with his partner and young daughter who, because of Covid restrictions, he hasn’t seen since Sunday night. As his doctor I am not going to disclose any more details of his injury, his surgery or provide daily accounts of his recovery.” “Any injury of this nature is complex + timescales uncertain but safe to say that Raul’s most immediate needs are simple: space, rest + peace. Raul + family very thankful for privacy they have been given + overwhelming support they have felt from the football family and beyond.” “Raul is extremely grateful for all the messages of goodwill he continues to receive, which will certainly help him during his recovery.” These types of injuries are typically very difficult to work out a return date from and therefore Wolves may look to January to find reinforcement. Ryan Mason suffered a head injury in 2017 and was forced to retire from the game. The former Spurs player has spoken bluntly and honestly regarding his thoughts around the league’s protocols on head injuries. “We live in a world with men wanting to be brave. Not many will stand up and say ‘I don’t feel right here’. That’s the industry football is and we’re probably still a little bit guilty of that if I’m being perfectly honest. I was very close to losing my life on a football pitch to an incident that was very similar,” said Mason. “I’ve spoken to many people over the last three and a half years and raised my concerns but nothing changed. The perception of that type of challenge hasn’t changed. The protocol for concussion hasn’t really changed a great deal. What is it going to take for us to take these types of challenges and injuries seriously.” <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229861397.jpg" alt="“He should be ready to leave hospital by early next week” Wolves doctor delivers good news on Raul Jimenez"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: David Luiz of Arsenal wearing a bloodied head bandage during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Emirates Stadium on November 29, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

Whilst Mason said it was an honest attempt to win the ball, because of the seriousness of the challenge there should be deterrents in place to prevent these types of incidents. “It was late and it was from behind. If on the floor with a knee or ankle it would be a yellow card. This type of challenge is viewed as an honest attempt, which this one was.” “I think it was honest but I do believe we have a responsibility as professionals to punish dangerous play. Until this type of challenge is viewed as dangerous play then I think we’ll keep getting these injuries. My long term vision is we change the perception of this type of injury. I don’t want heading to stop.” There has yet to be any statement from the Premier League or FA in regards to any reaction to the situation.
