Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain have, on Monday, been dealt a pair of blows on the personnel front, ahead of the club’s upcoming showdown with Manchester United. One of the marquee matchups of the latest round of Champions League fixtures is set to play out at Old Trafford in 24 hours’ time. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United will welcome PSG to the Theatre of Dreams, for the respective clubs’ penultimate Group H fixture. The clash marks an important one for both sides, albeit more so for the French heavyweights. As things stand, it is Manchester United who hold control of the group, sitting 3 points clear of both their opponents on Tuesday, and joint-2nd RB Leipzig. The Red Devils therefore require just a solitary point from their remaining two outings to be sure of qualification to the last-16. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1287484707-1024x683.jpg" alt="PSG dealt late double injury blow ahead of Man United/Martial sent home from Red Devils training"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 24: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United looks on as team mate Marcus Rashford of Manchester United prepares to take a penalty, leading to their team’s third goal during the UEFA Champions League Group H stage match between Manchester United and İstanbul Basaksehir at Old Trafford on November 24, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Thomas Tuchel’s outfit have followed up their trip to last season’s finale with an altogether shaky opening to the club’s Champions League campaign this time round. This of course included a defeat to United in Paris the last time the two sides met, when Marcus Rashford’s late strike secured a memorable 2-1 win for the former. As outlined above, however, PSG’s hopes of swift revenge at Old Trafford on Tuesday have today been dealt a blow. This comes in the form of a pair of fresh additions to the club’s treatment table. As confirmed by RMC Sport on Monday evening, both Mauro Icardi and Pablo Sarabia picked up injury problems in training over the last 24 hours.
