Chelsea have this evening been dealt a blow on the injury front, after Ben Chilwell was forced off during the early exchanges of the club’s meeting with West Ham. Frank Lampard’s men are currently locked in action with the Hammers, in their latest Premier League outing. The Blues of course entered the derby clash in desperate search of a bounce-back result. On the back of a 14-game unbeaten streak across all competitions, Chelsea had since fallen to consecutive defeats in their last two outings. A 1-0 downing at Everton was followed during the week by a 2-1 loss at the hands of Wolves, results which saw the capital outfit slip to 9th in the English top-flight table ahead of kick-off this evening. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230090424-1024x683.jpg" alt="Major concern for Chelsea as Ben Chilwell limps out of West Ham clash"/> Chelsea’s German midfielder Kai Havertz (R) runs with the ball as Everton’s English midfielder Ben Godfrey (L) close in during the English Premier League football match between Everton and Chelsea at Goodison Park in Liverpool, north west England on December 12, 2020.

With just 10 minutes on the clock, a whipped Mason Mount corner from the right was met by the unmarked Thiago Silva, who made no mistake in driving a fine header beyond Lukasz Fabianski in the West Ham goal: “It’s a textbook header!” Moments after losing Ben Chilwell to injury, Chelsea’s spirits are lifted as they take the lead through Thiago Silva.

The individual to have been forced off? Ben Chilwell. An innocuous challenge between Chilwell and West Ham attacker Jarrod Bowen early on saw the former’s foot become trapped, before turning awkwardly in the turf. The English international did his best to run off the issue, after being tended to by the hosts’ medical team. In the end, however, the pain simply proved too much, forcing Chilwell to limp off, with Emerson Palmieri introduced in his place: Chilwell going off injured. Huge blow for Chelsea. Emerson to come on. #CFC #CHEWHU — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) December 21, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
