Manchester United endured something of a mixed 2020 summer transfer window. Donny van de Beek was the first name through the door at Old Trafford, and will likely go on to prove a useful asset despite his limited minutes to date. Alex Telles is certainly an upgrade on United’s previous left-back options, whilst Edinson Cavani is no doubt a better back-up centre-forward than Odion Ighalo, who is set to leave the club in January. Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo are also extremely talented young prospects, who could develop into major contributors for the Red Devils down the line. However, despite, in the end, having done some decent business, Man United’s transfer window could easily still be looked upon as a failure. This comes with the club having not managed to secure a deal for Jadon Sancho, who was known to represent a key target of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United also failed to strengthen at centre-back, an area in which they have been lacking quality for some time. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg" alt="Solskjaer prioritising centre-half next year/ Man United  ‘unlikely’ to join the race for Bayern Munich’s David Alaba"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JANUARY 22: Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of Manchester United walks off at half time during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Burnley FC at Old Trafford on January 22, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Both RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano and Sporting’s David Carmo were linked with the Red Devils. It was even rumoured earlier this week that the Reds had made formal contact over a move for Bayern Munich’s David Alaba, who is out of contract in the summer. Now, on Thursday, a fresh update on United’s pursuit of defensive reinforcements has been forthcoming online. And it is something of a mixed bag. The Telegraph do claim that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s priority for next year is a centre-back. However, the report goes on to add that United are unlikely to join the race for Alaba.
