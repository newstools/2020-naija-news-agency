Mesut Ozil’s situation at Arsenal has been something of a mystery and frustration for so many Gunners fans. The German international was left out of the Premier League and Europa League squads by Mikel Arteta at the start of the current campaign. Arsenal are currently in one of their worst ever seasons in the modern era, specifically lacking massive amounts of creativity in the centre of the pitch. Ozil is known as a player for being a creator of goals and chances which has made the situation even more puzzling for Arsenal fans to try and understand why Mikel Arteta referenced the Germans omission from the squad being down to ‘football reasons.’ “Well everybody is free to express his feeling. What I can say from my side is that it is just a football decision,” he said. “My conscience is very calm because I have been really fair with him. My level of communication with him has been really high and we know what to expect with each other. “When I believed that he could contribute to the team to be better – which is why I was hired to this football club, to win football matches and competitions, and create and build a project in the short, medium and long term – he has had the opportunities like everybody else. Even prior to Arsenal showing a clear lack of creativity this season, it was obvious that the squad was lacking in that specific area. The club even tried to address this in the summer by pursuing the signing of Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar. However, Arsenal ultimately failed to bring in the Frenchman and yet still decided to not include Ozil in the upcoming season’s squad. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aouar.png" alt="PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 7: Houssem Aouar of France reacts during the international friendly match between France and Ukraine at Stade de France on October 7, 2020 in Paris, France.

The former has only seen one substitute appearance in the league so far in the 2-1 loss to Everton and the latter has been given chances but only impressed in the Europa League. Ultimately, all of these in combination have led to a serious issue when it comes to creating chances let alone goals. With January approaching and the next possible opportunity to register, Ozil has decided to take to social media and respond to his current situation. Since Ozil has not been able to play for the Arsenal side this season he has been using his social media as a way to support his teammates on the pitch. Regularly using his Twitter account to send messages of support, specifically to players when they are injured or to just get behind the team in general. On Wednesday evening he decided to do a Q&A session with fans and was asked how his current situation was at the club. “It’s a very difficult time for everyone around the club – not just for me. The situation is frustrating for everyone. Of course I would wish I could help the team especially right now, but as long as I don’t get the chance I just hope that we get better results very soon again. But let’s stay positive,” he wrote when asked if he was ‘happy’ at Arsenal. But let’s stay positive. — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) December 23, 2020 There have been links with Mesut Ozil possibly leaving Arsenal in January instead of being re-registered.
