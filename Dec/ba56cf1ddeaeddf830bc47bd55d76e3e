It’s fair to say that Arsenal’s 2020/21 campaign hasn’t gone the way many were expecting. Mikel Arteta appeared to have breathed new life into the club, guiding them to FA Cup and Community Shield success in the first 12 months of his stint at the Emirates. In turn, with the likes of Gabriel and Thomas Partey having arrived over the summer to improve weaker areas of the club’s squad, the Gunners faithful were no doubt largely optimistic ahead of the season getting underway. However, with 13 Premier League games played, 2020/21 has proven anything but positive from an Arsenal perspective. The north Londoners are down in 15th place in the English top-flight, having won just four games all season. Arsenal’s biggest issue this term has been a lack of goals, with the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette in dismal form in front of goal. In fact, the capital giants have scored just 11 times in the Premier League this season, with only Burnley, West Brom and Sheffield United having managed less. The Gunners’ latest outing saw them held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton. On its own, a point against the high-flying Saints is pretty solid. However, it has in no way helped Mikel Arteta’s cause, with tough games against Everton and Chelsea now on the horizon. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230113475-1024x617.jpg" alt="Bernd Leno insists Mikel Arteta ‘least to blame’ for Arsenal’s poor form"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta dejected on the touchline during the Premier League match at Emirates Stadium, London.

However, though the inexperienced Spaniard must take some responsibility for Arsenal’s poor form, there are certainly bigger issues to address. The running of the club and transfer model at Arsenal isn’t exactly perfect, with Willian the latest example of that. The players themselves should also shoulder some of the blame, with all of Nicolas Pepe, Granit Xhaka and Gabriel’s rash sending-offs costing the Gunners this season. Now, following their latest tie with Southampton, Bernd Leno has moved to defend Arteta, stating he is not an issue in the dressing room and there is no criticism of the former Manchester City coach: “That [pressure on Arteta] is not an issue at all. The coach is least to blame for the fact that we are in this situation. “If you look at the way we were running around on the pitch at times, then the players are the only ones to blame. I have to be honest about that. “We’re getting red cards, making mistakes, standing out of position. These are things that we have clearly addressed a thousand times. In the end, it’s a lack of focus on the part of the players. “The coach is not an issue in the dressing room, there is no criticism of him. We criticise ourselves and the players know that they are responsible. “We actually have quality, but all of a sudden there was this break. But nobody can pin it on just one person.” Quotes via Goal.
