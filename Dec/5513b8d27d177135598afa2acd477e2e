Manchester United’s 2020/21 campaign has been something of a mixed bag, to say the least. Their Premier League season got off to a rather poor start, with a defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford and, of course, that 6-1 hammering at the hands of Tottenham. However, the Reds did look to be slowly turning their season around. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side picked up huge wins over PSG and RB Leipzig in the Champions League group stages and have now won four in a row in the Premier League. But after a shock loss to Istanbul Basaksehir and then a complete collapse vs Leipzig earlier this week, United crashed out of the CL and are now once again set for another season of Europa League football. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227657295-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man United players reportedly want Solskjaer to stop making so many changes"/> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer leaves after the English Premier League football match between Crystal Palace and Manchester United at Selhurst Park in south London on July 16, 2020. – Manchester United won the game 2-0.

According to a report from the Telegraph on Thursday, United’s senior players fear the team’s erratic form is being exacerbated by too many tactical and selection changes from Solskjaer. This comes with OGS yet to name the same starting XI in back-to-back games this season. However, it is also added that the Norwegian maintains the backing of the board, with Ed Woodward believing that Solskjaer remains the man to lead the club forward. The Telegraph also claim Solskjaer remains well-liked by the players.
