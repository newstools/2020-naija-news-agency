Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur now know which Champions League teams which teams they could face in the knockout rounds of the Europa League. Today saw the conclusion of the UCL group stage fixtures and the final determination of the third place sides who will now drop into the second-tier UEFA competition. Dominik Szoboszlai’s Red Bull Salzburg failed to beat Atletico Madrid in Austria and, most likely without the Hungarian who is tipped to leave this January, will now fall into the Europa with Atleti joining Bayern Munich in the UCL knockouts. After a nail-biting end to the Inter Milan vs Shakhtar Donetsk game, the 0-0 draw in the Italian city meant that it will be the Ukrainian champions which qualify for Europa with Borussia Monchengladbach joining Real Madrid in the knockout rounds of the Champions League despite the 2-0 defeat in Spain. In group C, the side which knocked Arsenal out of last year’s competition Olympiacos will be thankful to Manchester City whose 3-0 win over Marseille confirmed their third place spot. The Greek side lost to Porto who join City in progressing but Olympiacos qualify for the Europa due to the French side’s defeat in Manchester. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1209120665-1024x606.jpg" alt="Arsenal and Spurs find out which Champions League dropouts they could face in the Europa League knockout rounds"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 27: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal reacts during the UEFA Europa League round of 32 second leg match between Arsenal FC and Olympiacos FC at Emirates Stadium on February 27, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The previous Champions League semi-finalists will join Dutch side PSV in the Europa knockouts. Depending on Thursday’s results, AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord could also progress into the next phase of the competition. Russian side Krasnodar will be the only Russian side left in Europe after they’re performances in a UCL group with Chelsea, Sevilla and Rennes saw them finish third and qualify for the Europa League. Perhaps the biggest win for the Europa clubs was seeing Sevilla progress through to the Champions League knockouts. The current Europa champions have an astonishing record in the competition but will be looking ahead to a possible bigger prize this season. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228144692-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arsenal and Spurs find out which Champions League dropouts they could face in the Europa League knockout rounds"/> Sevilla’s Brazilian defender Diego Carlos (2ndR) celebrates after Inter Milan’s Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku (R) deflected a shot to score an own goal for Sevilla to lead 3-2 during the UEFA Europa League final football match Sevilla v Inter Milan on August 21, 2020 in Cologne, western Germany.

The Italians finished second behind Borussia Dortmund after a group stage plagued with missing talent due to Covid infections and self isolation. Brugge will join league rivals Antwerp who face off against Spurs tomorrow night in a top of the group decider. Dynamo Kiev expectantly finished above Ferencvaros and behind European giants Juventus and Barcelona to drop into the Europa League. Onlookers should pay close attention to Ukrainian left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko, the 21-year-old is one of Europe’s most exciting talents. The arguable surprise drop of all though was Manchester United who finished behind both PSG and RB Leipzig despite winning against both sides in their first two matches. Defeat in Old Trafford against Neymar and co and finally a 3-2 loss in Germany saw United bemoan their shock result in Turkey against bottom of the group Istanbul Basaksehir.
