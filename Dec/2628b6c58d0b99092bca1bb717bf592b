The representative of Arsenal outcast Mesut Ozil has reiterated that his client has no intention of seeking out a new club in January. Much of the media chatter surrounding ongoings at the Emirates of late has of course centered on former German international Ozil. This comes with Mikel Arteta having doubled down on his efforts to freeze the ex-Real Madrid man out of his first-team setup. Upon Spanish tactician Arteta taking the reins in north London late last year, Ozil’s initial experience actually proved quite positive. The 32-year-old was afforded a consistent string of starts by his new boss, suggesting that he was set to prove central to the plans of Arteta moving forward. Bizarrely, however, since football’s return on the back of the initial Covid-19 outbreak during the summer, Ozil has not received a single minute of playing time. Arteta, meanwhile, has made crystal clear that this situation is unlikely to change any time soon, through a pair of high-profile calls. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg" alt="‘Not thinking of other clubs’ – Mesut Ozil’s agent confirms hopes of return to Arsenal setup"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

And this was swiftly followed by news that the gifted midfielder had also not been afforded a place in the Gunners’ 25-man Premier League panel. Arsenal’s Premier League squad in full.

Nevertheless, the widespread assumption has long remained that, with Arteta likely to be handed until at least the end of the campaign to fully prove himself, Ozil’s career in north London is all but over. In turn, speculation in the media had begun to mount of late that a January exit could be on the cards. Murat Zorlu, a member of congress at Turkish heavyweights Fenerbahce, even recently went as far as to suggest that a winter move to Istanbul had emerged as a near certainty for Ozil. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg" alt="‘Not thinking of other clubs’ – Mesut Ozil’s agent confirms hopes of return to Arsenal setup"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Speaking in an interview with Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb, Dr Erkut Sogut was, on Tuesday, drawn on the rampant speculation surrounding his client at present. Sogut, though, assured that Ozil’s focus remains firmly on Arsenal, with the former Schalke man intent on earning his place back in Mikel Arteta’s plans, before seeing out the remainder of his contract: ‘Even one day is a long time in football, you never know. Of course, there are many clubs interested in signing him.’ ‘This has never changed but his willingness to honour his contract and play hasn’t changed either. He’s a man of his word and is loyal, and loyalty is hard to find in these times. He is not thinking of other clubs except the one with which he is now under contract.’ ‘It’s a shame that Mesut isn’t playing. Of course, everyone focuses on his salary and I understand why. But from a personal perspective, I say it’s a waste considering his talent and creativity.’ ‘He is training harder than ever. At home he has a gym, in the garden and in the garage. So, in addition to the work he does with the club, he also trains at home. This shows his professionalism, all his seriousness.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
