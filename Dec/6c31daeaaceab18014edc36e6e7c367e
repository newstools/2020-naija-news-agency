Owner of YBNL record label and OG rapper, Olamide, has released the video to his Badboy Timz assisted hit record, ‚ÄòLoading‚Äô today, the 1st of December. <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Olamide-2-588x420.jpg" alt="Olamide Loading video"/> The video which was shot by Clarence Peters is a futuristic affair featuring colourfully clad dancers and trippy edits with the use of AR and VR. It also pays tribute to the late dancer, Picture Kodak who was mentioned on the record. Among the list of things featured is an iced out and dressed-to-kill BadboyTimz. However, there was no sight of Olamide in the three minutes, forty-five seconds long video. RELATED POST: Olamide Bares All On The Afrobeats Podcast With Adesope LIVE!
