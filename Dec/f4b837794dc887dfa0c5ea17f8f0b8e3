Arsenal’s supporters have flocked to social media this evening to make their frustrations known, after an incident involving Ben Chilwell and Daniel Podence saw the former go unpunished. Chelsea of course made the trip to Molineux a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. Frank Lampard’s men headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, having seen their 14-game unbeaten streak brought to a firm end by Everton over the weekend. In turn, the Blues were no doubt desperate to bag all 3 points this evening, ahead of the top-of-the-table clash between Tottenham and Liverpool in 24 hours’ time. When all was said and done in the West Midlands, however, not only did Chelsea fail to secure a bounce-back win, but the Pensioners were condemned to a 2nd-straight defeat. An entertaining affair eventually saw the visitors on the wrong end of a 2-1 result, leaving Lampard’s men on the outside looking in at the top-4 once more. The evening’s winner came with essentially the last kick of the game, as, after Daniel Podence had cancelled out Olivier Giroud’s volley in style, Pedro Neto burst free deep into injury-time, before slotting home a wonderful left-footed finish: NETO WINS IT!@Wolves take all three points in injury time thanks to Pedro Neto’s clinical finish #PLonPrime #WOLCHE pic.twitter.com/wzhJiUBO70 — Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 15, 2020 <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HAESNxljprU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe> As outlined above, however, on an altogether disappointing night for Chelsea, things could so easily have gone even worse for the Blues. 15 minutes from time at Molineux, a coming together off the ball between Ben Chilwell and Daniel Podence saw the former grab the Wolves star by the throat. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Chilwell-Podence.jpg" alt="Arsenal fans highlight VAR inconsistency after Chelsea’s Ben Chilwell escapes punishment vs Wolves"/> Podence, to his credit, did not go to ground, in a scuffle that eventually resulted in the Portuguese being booked. Chilwell, on the other hand, was handed no punishment, despite blatantly raising his hands to an opposing player. And one such fanbase who have since unsurprisingly taken particular issue with the handling of the incident as a whole are those of an Arsenal persuasion. This past weekend of course saw Granit Xhaka given his marching orders versus Burnley, on the back of similar actions, which saw the Swiss midfielder grab Ashley Westwood by the throat: | RED CARD!

Arsenal’s fans evidently think so, with just some of the social media reaction to tonight’s incident showcased below: Chilwell literally just did exactly what Xhaka did to Westwood and yet it wasn’t even checked by VAR — Dom (@DomC0801) December 15, 2020 Xhaka fully deserved his red card by putting his hand on someone’s throat but it was VAR that gave the red.. Why would VAR not do the exact same thing to Chilwell? I mean… pic.twitter.com/ssYCPsuf4G — Pen Griffey Jr. (@IBfresh25) December 15, 2020 Chilwell doing similar to Xhaka and there’s no check? Alright pic.twitter.com/UtuSqXFSly — ™️ (@D20048) December 15, 2020 Chilwell puts his hand on someone’s throat, yellow card.. Xhaka does the same, red card… Makes sense @premierleague — Michael Gonçalves  (@MGoncalves10) December 15, 2020 Pepe red card, Fred not a red card, Xhaka red card, Chilwell not a red card.
