A controversial moment during the first-half of the clash between Chelsea and West Ham United this evening has since seen droves of fans make their frustrations with VAR clear. Unfortunately, however, the system was not actually permitted to intervene. The Blues and Hammers are currently locked in action at Stamford Bridge. The clash marks a key one for the two London rivals, who headed into proceedings on the back of respective defeats in their prior outings. In turn, ahead of kick-off in the capital, Chelsea and West Ham were separated by just a solitary point in the Premier League table. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230090424-1024x683.jpg" alt="Why Jarrod Bowen’s soft disallowed equaliser vs Chelsea couldn’t be checked by VAR"/> Chelsea’s German midfielder Kai Havertz (R) runs with the ball as Everton’s English midfielder Ben Godfrey (L) close in during the English Premier League football match between Everton and Chelsea at Goodison Park in Liverpool, north west England on December 12, 2020.

With just 10 minutes on the clock, a whipped Mason Mount corner from the right was met by the unmarked Thiago Silva, who made no mistake in driving a fine header beyond Lukasz Fabianski in the West Ham goal: “It’s a textbook header!” Moments after losing Ben Chilwell to injury, Chelsea’s spirits are lifted as they take the lead through Thiago Silva.

After the ball was headed into the Chelsea box by Tomas Soucek, Thiago Silva got goal side of the advancing Jarrod Bowen, looking set to usher the ball back to Edouard Mendy with minimal fuss. The Brazilian, though, subsequently went to ground, with it having initially been assumed that this had come on the back of a push from Bowen, who followed up by lashing home beyond the onrushing Mendy. Replays, however, showcased minimal contact, amid suggestions that Silva actually tripped over his own feet. Nevertheless, a free-kick was awarded. In turn, many have since taken to social media to question why VAR did not intervene, with the decision to award a free-kick to the hosts having not even been checked: Thiago Silva dived so that Bowen goal should of stood but obviously VAR doesn’t help West Ham — Jonesy ☆ #GSBOUT (@RockyWhu) December 21, 2020 Just seen the replay Bowen doesn’t touch silva he trips over his own leg. What’s the point having var if t he can’t spot something simple like that? — Steve’ (@9JackSteveh) December 21, 2020 Premier League again and it’s rubbish officiating – Thiago Silva trips himself and dives after losing flight of the ball, West Ham get a legitimate goal chalked off – and no VAR check. Worst officated league around #CHEWHU #thiagosilva #Bowen #VAR #NBCSN — B  (@theklopposphere) December 21, 2020 How the hell has Thiago Silva got away with diving there? Nothing wrong with that Bowen goal. When is VAR going to do its job? — HungryDuck  (@LUFCPATRIOT69) December 21, 2020 Unfortunately, however, even if the Video Assistant Referee crew had hoped to intervene, they would not have been permitted to. This comes with replays of the incident having showcased the fact that referee Chris Kavanagh had already blown his whistle in Chelsea’s favour, before Bowen had found the net. In turn, a ‘goal’ was technically not scored, leaving VAR with nothing to check, as per the current rules in place in the Premier League.
