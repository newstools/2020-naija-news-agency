The development has led to mixed reactions on Twitter as Nigerians debated the low turnout. Most youths explained that their reason for not voting was because the Peoples Democratic Party as well as the All Progressives Congress – the two major parties – are birds of the same feather. Both APC and PDP are same set of people changing colour of agbada, we have both their records of failure, and SORO SOKE generation will not partake in electing further failure. We want total haulage come 2023. — Komolafe (@Komolaf11233521) December 5, 2020 Senator Jaywon @juuwoncares gave the excuse of location as his inability to vote. He asked, "How can I vote when I need to travel to my polling unit to cast my vote?"
