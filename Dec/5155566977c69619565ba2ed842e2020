The Elliott Award which was established in 2016 is given by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) in partnership with ONE and the Elliott family aims to “advance the work of an emerging journalist covering Africa who strives to strengthen people’s voices and improve their well-being.” Its previous winners include Kenyan journalists Mercy Juma and Dorcas Wangira, and Nigerian journalist Abubakar Ibrahim. “Mordi’s work demonstrates extreme courage, tenacity, investigative ability and the patience needed to tell such a complex story with undeniable evidence. It is Africa’s answer to #MeToo.” the 2019 Elliott Award winner and a member of this year’s jury Wangira said. “The Elliott family is proud to work with ICFJ and ONE, and our many generous supporters, to help advance the development of quality journalism in Africa. We congratulate this year’s winner, Kiki Mordi, for her courageous and influential work, and finalist Mahmoud Elwakea for his creative multimedia story on an important topic. I am grateful to the staff of ICFJ, and to my fellow judges for their careful review of the many inspiring entries. I am especially grateful to Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of the Los Angeles Times], a longtime friend and mentor to my late husband, for his wise guidance of the selection process since the program’s inception.” Emma Oxford, Elliott’s widow said.
