View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ikechukwu Onunaku (@official_ikechukwu) According to Ikechukwu, he cannot believe that Davido and Burna Boy exchanged blows and thinks it was incredulous that Wizkid was also drinking by the corner, unbothered. He also pointed out the lack of video evidence and asked for video footage to that effect saying both Davido and Burna are mature men and wouldn’t allow things to escalate regardless of intoxication. He called the news fake and blamed the reports on clout chasers.
