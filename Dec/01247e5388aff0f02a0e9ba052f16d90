Manchester United endured something of a mixed summer transfer window. Donny van de Beek was the first name through the door at Old Trafford, and will likely go on to prove a useful asset. Alex Telles is almost certainly an upgrade on United’s current left-backs, whilst Edinson Cavani is no doubt a better back-up centre-forward than Odion Ighalo, who is set to leave the club in January. Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo are also extremely talented young prospects, who could develop into major contributors for the Red Devils down the line. However, despite, in the end, having done some decent business, Man United’s transfer window could easily still be looked upon as a failure. This comes with the club having not managed to secure a deal for Jadon Sancho, who was known to represent a key target of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United also failed to strengthen at centre-back, an area in which they have been lacking quality for some time. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg" alt="Man United reportedly want to make four new signings"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JANUARY 22: Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of Manchester United walks off at half time during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Burnley FC at Old Trafford on January 22, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

According to the Manchester Evening News, United are aiming to complete their squad overhaul across the next two transfer windows by having two quality players available for each position at the start of next season. In terms of the positions being targeted the MEN claim the Red Devils are eyeing a ready-made winger (presumably a right-sided winger, though the report doesn’t mention it), a centre-back, a right-back and a defensive midfielder. However, the MEN then add that the expectation is there will be no incomings in the upcoming January window.
