John Stones joined Manchester City in 2016. The then highly-rated youngster has since gone on to endure something of a hit and miss stint at the Etihad. A couple of high-profile mistakes for both club and country have seemingly, for the most part, seen Pep Guardiola lose faith in Stones, with Fernandinho often a preferred choice at centre-back last term. This season has seen Stones put in a few decent performances, most recently against Burnley and Olympiacos. But the stopper has still been limited to just six outings across all competitions, two of which were brief sub appearances. And now, Stones is being linked with a January move. As per Goal, citing Eurosport, Arsenal are considering a January swoop for Stones, with Mikel Arteta having identified the Englishman as a possible target. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273517636-1024x613.jpg" alt="Arsenal linked with January move for Man City’s John Stones/ Seaman believes Zaha would be good addition for Gunners"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace scores a penalty for his team’s second goal during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on September 19, 2020 in Manchester, England.

The Gunners were quite heavily linked with the Ivorian in the summer of 2019 and those links did re-emerge somewhat this year. Zaha has also had a solid start to the campaign, netting five and assisting two in eight league outings. And when speaking about Zaha recently, Seaman had this to say: “I think Zaha would be a good addition to Arsenal because he’s a proven goalscorer. “I don’t know the reason why it hasn’t happened as he obviously wants to come. Whether it’s the agents and clubs not agreeing certain things, that must be the reason, but he’s made it clear that he wants to come as he’s an Arsenal fan. “He would be a good addition to the squad, no doubt at all.” Quotes via the Evening Standard.
