He is an example of what a multi-disciplinary creative is. One who balances his talent and love for Art, but also believes in using his fame, influence, knowledge, and expertise to create a bigger impact in the lives of others. Many creatives were never taught financial management. Nobody groomed us on how to manage our resources, improve our income with investments, and make our money work for us. Some of us had to make multiple mistakes and learn the hard way. I think there is a place for the work, Dr. Caise does. He isn’t just another financial expert with a degree and masters in Finance…but one who blends his educational background and understands the genuine trouble spot and money challenges of every practicing creative.” You can find out more by visiting his website.To attend the course – Register at www.DrCaise.com About Dr. Caise Dr. Caise, the creative formerly known as DJ Caise is an astute business leader and multiple award-winning creatives who has gained a reputation for his unique approach to helping people achieve their goals and transform their lives, through his professional experience in developing and implementing business growth strategies, engineering process optimization and operational effectiveness and championing healthy financial decision making.
