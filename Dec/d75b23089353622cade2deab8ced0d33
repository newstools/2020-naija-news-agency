Olivier Giroud left Arsenal for Chelsea in January of 2018. And the Frenchman has since gone on to enjoy a decent stint at Stamford Bridge. The first half of last season saw Giroud barely afforded a minute of action in the Premier league. This resulted in January speculation that the veteran forward was set to be on the move, with Tottenham and Inter Milan linked. However, in the end, a move failed to come to fruition. Amid the struggles of Tammy Abraham for both form and fitness, though, Giroud was subsequently handed a number of starts over the second half of the campaign. The opening months of the current season, however, saw the attacker’s time on the pitch slashed once again. In turn, with the European Championships just around the corner, France boss Didier Deschamps urged Giroud to ‘find another solution’. Recent weeks, though, have seen Frank Lampard make yet another U-turn when it comes to the Frenchman’s place in his side. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1185587805-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chelsea reportedly hoping to keep hold of Giroud until June"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 30: Olivier Giroud of Chelsea warming up before the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and West Ham United at Stamford Bridge on November 30, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by James Williamson – AMA/Getty Images) Giroud has featured in the Blues’ last four Champions League outings, across which he has scored five goals. The 34-year-old has also started Chelsea’s last three league ties. The Londoners didn’t fare overly well in these games, though Giroud nevertheless managed to net twice. And now, with the winter window fast approaching, an update on Chelsea’s transfer stance when it comes to their powerful hitman has been forthcoming. A few months back, it wouldn’t have sounded too outlandish to hear that Giroud was set to leave Stamford Bridge in January. However, as per a recent report from Italian outlet Calciomercato, written by the reliable Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea are pushing to keep Giroud – who is garnering interest from both Milan clubs – until June. This, of course, marks when his current contract is due to expire.
