Updates on the fitness of a pair of big-name Premier League strikers have been provided by their respective managers this evening. First up is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Gabonese hitman Aubameyang’s Arsenal made the trip to Goodison Park earlier today, for a meeting with Everton. The Gunners were eventually condemned to a 2-1 defeat, courtesy of an own goal from captain-for-the-day Rob Holding, and a Yerry Mina header: EVERTON LEAD Alex Iwobi’s cross is flicked on by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Arsenal’s stand-in captain Rob Holding puts it into his own net!

The aforementioned Aubameyang actually played no part in his side’s latest defeat, though, after picking up a calf problem in training during the week. In turn, following the full-time whistle at Goodison, Arteta was inevitably drawn on the wellbeing of the Gunners’ captain. And the Spaniard went on to explain: Arteta couldn’t put an exact timeframe on Aubameyang’s absence. “It could be one or two weeks,” he said. He says it depends how the injury evolves over the next few days. — Charles Watts (@charles_watts) December 19, 2020 Elsewhere on the Premier League injury front on Saturday, Danny Ings was forced off during Southampton’s meeting with Manchester City. The Saints, like Arsenal, saw their woes compounded by an eventual defeat, as Raheem Sterling’s solitary strike guided the Sky Blues to all 3 points at St. Mary’s: <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuxirA1jDi0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe> And, during his post-match interview, Ralph Hasenhüttl confirmed that the news regarding his side’s star attacker also looks far from positive, with Ings having picked up a hamstring injury: ‘It’s a hamstring problem. I’m not sure how much, but it’s clear we were taking a risk with another game for 90 minutes when he has played twice in the week after the long injury, so we hope it’s not too bad.’ An update from the boss on the injury sustained by #SaintsFC striker @IngsDanny: — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) December 19, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
