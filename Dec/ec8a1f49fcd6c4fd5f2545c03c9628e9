Royal Exchange Insurance Plc – The Company started operations in Nigeria represented by Barclays Bank DCO in 1918. A branch of the then parent Company, Royal Exchange Assurance, London, (REA), was established in Lagos on February 28, 1921. REA was founded in 1720 and was one of the first two insurance companies to receive legal status by Royal Charter. Originally established for marine business, REA expanded within a year to include fire and life insurance as well, thereby becoming Britain’s first composite insurer. The establishment of the branch in Nigeria was the result of the expansion drive of REA in the early 20th century. Pursuant to Section 396(2) of the then Companies Act of 1968 the Company was, on December 29, 1969, reconstituted and incorporated as a Private Limited Liability Company, the Royal Exchange Assurance (Nigeria) Limited. The Company went public on July 18, 1989 and was duly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange on December 3, 1990. The Company elected to split its operations into Life and General Businesses during the 2007 recapitalization exercise. Upon this decision Royal Exchange General Insurance Company Limited (REGIC) was adopted as the name to underwrite general business.
