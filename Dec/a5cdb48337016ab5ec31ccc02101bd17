Manchester United’s comfortable victory over Leeds United this evening saw the dominance of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men perfectly summed up by one impressive statistic. The Red Devils welcomed Marcelo Bielsa’s outfit to Old Trafford a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. The clash of course marked a historic one, pitting two of English football’s oldest rivals against one another in a league clash for the first time in 16 years, following Leeds’ return to the top-flight. When all was said and done at the Theatre of Dreams, though, the visitors were dealt a harsh dose of reality. An absolutely hectic 90 minutes eventually saw Manchester United emerge on the right side of a 6-2 scoreline. Scott McTominay put the hosts on their way with an early brace, before further strikes from all of Bruno Fernandes (2), Victor Lindelof and Dan James rounded out a dominant victory for Solskjaer’s men.
