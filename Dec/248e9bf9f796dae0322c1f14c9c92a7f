Tiwa had this to say about the current situation of the protests: Everyone’s just kind of like regrouping, going back because the #EndSARS was just a catalyst. It was just to bring awareness to bigger pictures. It wasn’t just about ending police brutality, it was about ending injustice, bad governance and just fighting for a better country for us, for our children, and for the future. So it was a great start because it was a peaceful protest, obviously it didn’t end well, but we move, and I think everyone is just regrouping and just figuring out come 2023, we all realize that we all have a voice and we have to use it.
