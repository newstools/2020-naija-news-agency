We approached The Colors of Cool Collection with our favorite in-house rule – NO RULES AND NO BOUNDARIES, and this time with BOLD AND COOL COLORS. Not much seriousness went into creating this collection, it’s been a very dark year and what better way to brighten things up than to add some bold and cool colors into our dressing. With new takes on our usual play on the Aso-Oke fabric to our signature contemporary two-toned Buba & Sokoto and contrast stitchings – The collection includes fresh and quirky color combinations that’s fused with relaxed silhouettes and detailing. <img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131449145_734397284140494_7939875492052486657_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131027990_108346854476197_8716860824690745007_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/130698208_3619573798088670_3280823519953230047_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131369309_409602500187600_1883253745336457693_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131466499_678015892907475_48963985835450346_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131040619_704686306715694_2744994674903299473_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131334991_219792323054049_318412363080795601_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/130800361_682150209111781_4087987697344184125_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131296466_437250334101593_8693186781156545649_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131410845_231436235041568_1603081906312970966_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131002536_2800211996883458_872836199690442371_n.jpg"/><img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/131467569_187267873090496_8588553597187446081_n.jpg"/>Credits Photography @tosin.akinyemiju Modeled by @toyinaroundtown The post NiNiE Official’s ‘Colors of Cool’ Collection Makes A Strong Case For Matching Separates appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
