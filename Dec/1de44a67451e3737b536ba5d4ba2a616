The nominees for November’s Premier League Player of the Month have this afternoon been revealed, with stars from some of the division’s biggest clubs included. Last month came as something of a quiet one when it came to action in the English top-flight, albeit only due to the latest international break. Across the outings which did take place, however, the Premier League’s characteristic brand of end-to-end, pulsating entertainment was on full display. Amongst the highlight results were Southampton’s remarkable 4-3 downing of Aston Villa, the Villans’ subsequent 3-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates, and Manchester United’s 3-goal turnaround at St. Mary’s last weekend. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1288438573-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chelsea &amp; Man United stars among nominees for latest PL Player of the Month"/> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: Edinson Cavani of Manchester United celebrates after he heads in and scores a goal to make it 3-2 during the Premier League match between Southampton and Manchester United at St Mary’s Stadium on November 29, 2020 in Southampton, England.

At the other end, Sheffield United continued to toil in their search of a first league win of the campaign, with the Blades having managed a paltry single point from their 10 outings thus far. On the other hand, things are beginning to look up at Fulham, who secured victories over both West Brom and Leicester in November. As such, with the dust having now settled on another thrilling month of top-flight action in England, the opportunity to look back at some of the standout performers has since been provided. And, in turn, as is customary, the nominees for the latest Player of the Month award have today been revealed.
