Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo has, on Tuesday, secured his latest piece of individual silverware, bagging the 2020 Golden Foot. The Golden Foot is an annual prize, awarded to one of European football’s standout performers. The award, first introduced back in 2003, is voted for by the general public, who decide on an eventual winner from a selection of ten nominees. A somewhat unusual accolade, in that it can only be bagged once by any single player, previous winners include the likes of Alessandro Del Piero, Ryan Giggs, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Andres Iniesta. And, as outlined above, last year’s recipient, in the form of Luka Modric, has today been replaced by one of his former Real Madrid teammates as the holder. The player in question? Cristiano Ronaldo. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1148787609.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo beats out Messi &amp; more to bag 2020 Golden Foot award"/> Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal with the Nations League trophy during the UEFA Nations League final match between Portugal and The Netherlands at Estadio do Dragao on June 09, 2019 in Porto, Portugal(Photo by VI Images via Getty Images) As announced on Tuesday, Juventus superstar Ronaldo has been crowned the 18th Golden Foot winner.
