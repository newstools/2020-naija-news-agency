The future of Christian Eriksen has remained uncertain for a significant period of time. The Danish international joined Inter Milan from Spurs in January of 2020 and yet, despite less than a year passing, Eriksen is already disillusioned at the Nerazzurri due to a lack of game time. This has therefore led to plenty of questions surrounding the Dane’s future and now Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has confirmed that he will look to move on from San Siro in the upcoming winter window. “Yes, I can confirm that Christian Eriksen is on the transfer list. He’s gonna leave in January. He’s not functional to our plans and he had difficulty here at Inter. I think it’s right that Christian goes away to find more space,” said Marotta.

I think it’s right that Christian goes away to find more space”.  #Eriksen — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) December 23, 2020 Eriksen himself has admitted that the move to Inter has not exactly been what he expected. Having such a pedigree in the Premier League, it was thought that Eriksen would slot straight into Antonio Conte’s side and provide plenty of service to forwards Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez. “This isn’t what I dreamed of,” Eriksen told TV2. “All players want to play as much as possible, but the coach decides who gets to go on the pitch. “It is a strange situation, as the fans want to see me playing more and so would I, but the coach has different ideas and as a player I have to respect that.” Eriksen has been linked with a move to Arsenal in January and considering the side’s lack of creativity this is no surprise. However, it would be wise of Arsenal to avoid falling into the trap of moving for the former Spurs player. On the surface it may seem like a good idea for the Gunners to pursue someone who, in the Premier League, was one of the most creative players the division has witnessed. However, Arsenal needs to be savvy in the transfer market and have made continual mistakes spending huge amounts of money on players which have not yet constituted their relevant fees. Examples of this are not lacking in frequency. Shkodran Mustafi, Granit Xhaka, Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe have cost the club serious amounts and have yet to display an equal return for the price paid. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229736932-1024x682.jpg" alt="Arsenal-linked Christian Eriksen confirmed to be leaving Inter in January by club CEO"/> Arsenal’s French-born Ivorian midfielder Nicolas Pepe (L) is shown a red card by atch Referee Anthony Taylor (2R) during the English Premier League football match between Leeds United and Arsenal at Elland Road in Leeds, northern England on November 22, 2020.

The sensible option is for Arsenal to pursue a possibly cheaper deal for a player with Premier League experience and who would take very little time to transition into Arsenal’s squad. The Gunners need an injection of quality immediately and do not have time for a player to transition across the rest of the season before having the desired impact they need. Eriksen could do that theoretically, however, having shown elements of a decline during his latter period at Spurs and throughout the year in Italy it would be a huge risk to pin hopes on his shoulders.
