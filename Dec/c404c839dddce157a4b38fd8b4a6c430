Arsenal are in a desperately dire situation, currently sitting just a few points above the relegation zone and having won just one game in their last 10 league appearances. Arsenal face Chelsea in their next Premier League fixture with very little hope of picking up significant points, if any, in their match against the Blues. After, Arsenal face a series of more favourable fixtures, however, considering their poor form in the league, no points are guaranteed from any games and Mikel Arteta is now very much aware of the impending situation should Arsenal fail in these clashes. “The next seven to eight days are going to be crucial to see where we’re going to be heading to in the Premier League,” said Arteta about the prospect of relegation. “At the moment, to keep the team together and alive, to be a team rather than a group of players, takes a lot of energy,” Arteta added. “You have to get them to be positive to each other, to not start blaming any external factors or any individuals when things are not going well. The best thing to do when you are like that is to have the possibility to do things outside our site. Get them together, change the environment, but at the moment we can’t do that.” <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-1-1024x699.jpg" alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 17: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal talks to Thomas Partey of Arsenal before making his debut during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on October 17, 2020 in Manchester, England.

But it takes a lot of energy because when you are losing games, every game is a lot of weight on your shoulders.” “People are suffering, we are hurting and you have to get back, be the leader again and try to push the players. The players respond and are excited again for the game. That’s happening but the best medicine is to win against Chelsea.” Whilst the Chelsea game seems an unlikely chance for The Gunners to pick up extra points, especially the desperate 3 that is needed, there is always hope that with the return of some players Arsenal could turn things around. Gabriel Martinelli was a very welcome addition to the line-up against Manchester City and, despite suffering an apparent injury, could return again against Chelsea to put on a commanding display, much like he did at Stamford Bridge last season. The leadership on the field for Arsenal has been something in question for a long period of time now. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been the current captain of the club for some time now, however, the Gabonese forward is not perceived by much of the fanbase to be a leader on the field. There are few characters within the dressing room which come across like the type to drag this team out of the current situation. But one such player who seemingly does encapsulate that of a player willing to do anything he can to push the side forward is that of Kieran Tierney. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1166836480.jpg" alt="Mikel Arteta aware of looming relegation fight if Arsenal’s results do not improve soon / Tierney backed to claim captaincy"/> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – AUGUST 08: New Arsenal signing Kieran Tierney at London Colney on August 08, 2019 in St Albans, England.

League winning Arsenal forward Paul Merson believes that Aubameyang should be stripped of the captaincy and Tierney given the opportunity to drag his side forwards. “I would give it to Tierney as he’d run through a brick wall for you,” said Merson. “He’s the one player I look at who gives everything, and I’d give him the captaincy. There’s a way of showing how much you care, and the relationship he is building with Bukayo Saka down the left looks decent. “Arsenal need that all around the pitch, and at the moment they’re in a relegation battle. For me, I don’t see them doing what Burnley are capable of, rolling their sleeves up. Arsenal are searching for the perfect win but they need to start grinding out results.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
