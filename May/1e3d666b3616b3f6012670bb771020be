As per a report from Football Insider, Tottenham Hotspur have stepped up their pursuit of Bournemouth’s Ryan Fraser, with a contract offer currently being readied. 26-year-old winger Fraser has been plying his trade at the Vitality Stadium since 2013, when he arrived from Aberdeen. And, after playing a key role in the club’s promotion to the Premier League in 2016, the Scot has since gone from strength to strength. It was his stellar production last season, though, which saw many begin to stand up and take notice of Fraser’s talents. Across appearances in all 38 of Bournemouth’s league fixtures (35 starts), the pacy wide-man directly contributed to 21 goals. His haul of 14 assists, meanwhile, proved the 2nd-highest total in the English top-flight, behind only Eden Hazard. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1054185084-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 27: Callum Wilson of AFC Bournemouth celebrates with teammate Ryan Fraser after scoring a penalty for his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Fulham FC and AFC Bournemouth at Craven Cottage on October 27, 2018 in London, United Kingdom.

Last summer saw Arsenal persistently touted as a potential destination for Fraser, with the Cherries star having also been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool in January.

Recent weeks, though, have seen a new frontrunner in the race for the 26-year-old pushed by the media. The outfit in question are Tottenham. Football Insider even recently suggested that Fraser himself has set his sights on a Lilywhites switch ahead of next season. And, as outlined above, FI have today provided a further update on the situation. Spurs are said to have stepped up their interest in the soon-to-be free agent, with Daniel Levy and co. currently ‘putting together a contract offer’ in a bid to entice Fraser to north London ahead of the 2020/21 campaign. ‘A Tottenham source has told Football Insider that the club are set to offer a lucrative contract to Fraser after he climbed to the top of their shopping list.’ Interestingly, word of Tottenham’s urgency to seal a deal for Fraser comes just 24 hours after it was claimed that the capital giants have no funds at their disposal this summer, and will therefore be focusing their attentions on free agents.
