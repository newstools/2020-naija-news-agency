According to her, she did not lie as she only told her story based on how it happened from her own point of view. She stated that she allowed the hurt and pain from past dealings to take over her emotions, and she asked for understanding and patience from everyone supporting her. Cynthia used the medium to formally introduce herself as ‘The Madrina’ and also made sure to thank Joy and Jude for giving her the Cynthia Morgan brand. #letterfromcynthiamorgan pic.twitter.com/83D5RuXSJA — theofficialmadrina (@madrinafire) May 27, 2020 The post Cynthia Morgan Sends Open Letter To Jude Okoye, & Her Ex-Manager, Joy Tongo appeared first on tooXclusive.
