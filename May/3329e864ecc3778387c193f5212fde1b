Being married to you, is so fun! – daily dancing and laughter, growth and progression. Making the moves we’ve always talked about, and living out our dreams together. Look at us – two marriage skeptics, having the best life being married. ⠀
6 months is nothing in comparison to what we have ahead of us, but … we’ve built our foundation during these months and it’s pretty damn great. ⠀
⠀
And it’s only the beginning.
I just really like you 🤤, you continue to make me blush.
I love you so much. ❤️⠀ <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1407460" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/96359645_223659682269478_7328103821017726238_n.jpg?resize=1080%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Photo Credit: blackbassey | iamnadiaann The post It has been 6 Months of Love, Laughter & Daily Dancing for #BBNaija’s Bassey & Wife Nadia ❤️ appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
