confirmed 0, deaths 0, recovered 0 We have read the dubious statements published in The Vanguard newspaper of Friday, May 22, 2020, and credited to Rodnab Construction Limited wherein it claimed that the queries from the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation in respect of the contract awarded to it for the completion of the head office building of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) was non-existent. It is clear that what Rodnab and its patrons are trying to do is to win public sympathy and change the narrative against the backdrop of the probe by the National Assembly of the fraudulent deals perpetrated by the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC under the supervision of Chief Godswill Akpabio, Minister for Niger Delta Affairs.
