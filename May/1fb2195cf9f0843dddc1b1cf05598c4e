Chelsea’s search for summer reinforcements appears to have taken the club to Portugal, with the agent of Porto star Jesus Corona having confirmed that he held discussions with the Blues over a potential Stamford Bridge switch for his client. Corona, 27, has been plying his trade at the Estádio do Dragão since 2015. The Mexican international made the move to Portugal from Dutch outfit FC Twente, and has since gone on to establish himself as a key member of Sérgio Conceição’s squad. Corona’s most intriguing trait is his versatility, with the central American capable of lining out either on the wing or as a full-back, on either side of the park. Recent seasons, though, have seen Corona primarily deployed on the right, in a more attacking role. And, after directly contributing to an impressive 22 goals across all competitions last season, the Monterrey youth product’s stellar production has since continued to this point in the current campaign. In 41 appearances, Corona has notched 2 goals and a whopping 17 assists. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1211136691-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> PORTO, PORTUGAL – MARCH 07: Jesus Corona of FC Porto in action during the Liga Nos match between FC Porto and Rio Ave FC at Estadio do Dragao on March 07, 2020 in Porto, Portugal.

The outfit in question? Premier League giants Chelsea. The Blues are expected to enter the market for reinforcements out wide this summer, as the contracts of both Willian and Pedro Rodriguez inch towards expiration. And, speaking in an interview with Medio Tiempo this week, Corona’s agent, Matias Bunge, confirmed that he recently discussed the possibility of a Stamford Bridge switch for his client with the Chelsea hierarchy: ‘At some point we talked to them [Chelsea]. I cannot say if he’s option A, B or C, now they are rather rumours.’ Bunge continued: ‘We’ll have to wait a bit for this to continue moving forward and for the leagues to begin again, and from there see what the next movements will be because the market is a little bit stopped.’ ‘He has two years left on his contract. He did awaken a lot of interest for his participation in this particular tournament [Primera Liga], which has been outstanding and at a high level, but now with the current situation of the virus everything has slowed down a bit, the signings are in quarantine.’ Best Netflix, Amazon & YouTube football documentaries & movies to watch during coronavirus isolation 9 best football documentaries to watch on ESPN+ during COVID-19 quarantine Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
