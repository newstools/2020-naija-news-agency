confirmed 0, deaths 0, recovered 0 <img class="alignnone wp-image-136617" src="https://i0.wp.com/tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Oritsefemi-e1482799779263.jpg?resize=512%2C766&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="512" height="766" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The singer released the visuals for his highly anticipated single “Obey” but it’s gotten attention for wrong reasons. You would recall seeing a video that showed two policemen brutally attacking a woman for supposedly disobeying the lockdown orders. It caused an uproar and Nigerians took to social media to call for their dismissal. The singer sang about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected everyone and also made reference to the unfortunate incident that happened by mocking the lady in the video for being the own originator of her misfortune. Oritsefemi advised that everyone should stay at home in order not to be slapped for failing to obey simple instructions. Do you remember the viral video of a lady that was flogged by some rogue @PoliceNG men in Iwo, Osun state? @oritsefemi used the same video in his new music video justifying the actions of the policemen who have since been dismissed.
