Fated to be a contender for the biggest Nigerian hit of the year 2020 and definitely’s Neptune signature hit, Joeboy opens up the bop with melodious lines before processing into a repetitive but highly potent ear-worm hook which is further complimented by Eazi’s offering. Verdict on the Magic Sticks produced cut? Catchy and Cliche? Probably! Effective and Efficient? Hell Yeah! The post DJ Neptune – “Nobody” ft. Joeboy & Mr. Eazi
