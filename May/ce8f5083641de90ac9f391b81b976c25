The cutting-edge “immersive screen” will provide users with a one-of-a-kind true full screen viewing experience. With its upgraded AI Camera 3.0 algorithm and AI Scene Detection, users will transform their photography experience: elevating the quality of photos they take, and making full use of the phone’s six flashes– including four which are situated around the rear camera with dual front camera flash. With the macro mode, users will be able to take extreme close-ups up to four cm away from the subject, allowing them to focus on the details that matter. The SPARK 5 also features AI HDR technology which increases dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera’s sensors, allowing users to take photos with less noise and sharper details. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-258052" src="https://i2.wp.com/tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Picture1-1.png?resize=351%2C197&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="351" height="197" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The Spark 5 comes in 2 variants; KD6-Spark 5 air and KD7H-Spark 5.
