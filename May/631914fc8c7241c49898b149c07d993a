The sporting director of Norwegian outfit Fram Larvik has seemingly confirmed Arsenal’s capture of free agent starlet George Lewis. Lewis, a 19-year-old winger, has spent his career to date plying his trade chiefly in the lower divisions in his home country of Norway. The Rwandan-born teen began his career on the books of Tromso IL, before dropping down to 3rd-tier outfit Tromsdalen. Lewis was soon on the move once more, though, when he departed the Tromso region for Fram Larvik. The pacy wide-man, who can play on either flank but is primarily utilised on the right, also spent time in England, when, according to Footbal.London, he trained with 5th-tier outfit Solihull Moors, with Lewis thought to have enjoyed a short spell on trial with Ipswich earlier this year, too. After failing to earn himself a contract, though, the youngster returned to his home country, where Lewis has since remained as a free agent. As outlined above, however, while Lewis’ first attempts to carve out a path for himself in English football went awry, the Norwegian, who has yet to be capped at any level by his country, now looks set to be handed the chance to impress at one of the Premier League’s biggest clubs. The wide-man’s destination?

Speaking in an interview with VG, Jostein Jensen, sporting director of the teen’s former club Fram Larvik, revealed: ‘Yes, we can confirm that. I have been told that he (Lewis) has signed for Arsenal.’ This comes on the back of claims that Lewis impressed during a two-week trial in north London back in March. As per the Evening Standard, the starlet’s combination of blistering pace and ability to beat opposing defenders proved enough to catch the eye of Arsenal’s coaches, with Lewis expected to link up with Steve Bould’s Under-23 side for the 2020/21 campaign. Jonathan Hill, who handed the Arsenal-bound attacker his debut with Tromsdalen, provided the following insight into Lewis’ abilities: ‘He’s got some really outstanding qualities, but he’s also raw. If this happens, it’s brilliant because he does have some talent.’ ‘He’s very quick and direct. He likes a stepover and has a range of tricks. He can beat a player – whether he can beat a Premier League full-back though is a different thing.’ Career to date Playing style What have they said? Who is George Lewis?
