If you no de see am that means you blind like what’s on my window ….
My people get the way them take dey like Buhari fans

Na small thing I for break e head Erigga na beast
I dey one side dey look una, all una yarns na shit
Personally na me allow God let una exist You rappers are baby diapers no wonder you full of shit
Use your contract clear my yansh look am now e no full of shit
Diamond necklace for my neck but you no de see am

Oh God the whip all red that’s the color

Shoutout to my men for the Warri and my Yenagoa boys wey dey school for Ozoro
Streets dey talk who dey hot now?
You gon get the news when you touchdown
My young niggas out still banging they gon do a nigga dirty if they catch him lacking uptown Gaddamn it look like I’m carrying
Something for the Judas Iscariots
I told you Move with the chariot
Declined my offer now look you embarrassing
You ain’t got swag like 6ix not smoov like me not sicker than the Doctor

Bro bro Verse 3 – Dr Barz You don see am?
Abobbi how e dey be
You wan see am?
In LA-GOS state for the update
So that my pockets
Owo go full am
It’s alright if you call me a dope dealer
My music will get me my first Milla
On the track I’m a venomous godzilla
Shoutout to Born Sinner
Sheybi you wan see am? Everyday I’m on my grind
I’m never making excuses
I’d rather just make me some 9 –
Figures in dollars brothers
Imma ball so hard that
Pretty ladies just give me their time
And head
Getting ahead of my time
While getting ahead on my rhyme
Sound the alarm
The south is awake in their prime
And we’re proof in the booth
Spitting goof on the line Yung6ix
You done see am
You done see am ? You won see am again Chuuuwo
You done see am ? You won see am again Chuuuwo
You done see am ? You won see am again Chuuuwo
You done see am ? You won see am again Verse 4 – Yung6ix I told myself that I had to win
I had nobody to play for my team
Was sicker than COVID when I was 19
Now the whole block wanna play for my team
Saw my first mill before I saw 18
Stones on my wrist
It cost me 18
You ain’t my blood if you ain’t got my genes
So you can’t wear my shoes cuz it won’t fit your jeans I don’t play games
Only Game of Thrones
They count the bodies but the bones don’t count
We both Nigerian so we know the zones
Haters just like votes and the votes don’t count They painted me bad
Take the good out of me
But I’m still the one like take two out of 3
They knew I was patient
Cuz I had the dream
Sowed millions in bitcoin and that’s what I reap (6ix way) Outro
