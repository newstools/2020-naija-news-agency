This is why we will be showing you this beautiful bridal collection by Ghanaian designer, Sima Brew. Each piece in the Utopian collection is so fascinating. Any bride who rocks these looks should be ready for stares and compliments.  Here’s how the designer, Sima Brew describes the collection: I believe that in every woman, there’s a Queen, and for every Queen, there’s the perfect specimen of man; her kIng. When a queen decides to take the walk down the aisle to marry her King she deserves to be draped in the finest. She deserves to look radiant, she deserves to glow, she deserves to be flawless. Designed with love and the best material, worthy of being worn by royalty, I present to all my Queens out there-UTOPIAN. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1248936" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sima-Brew-Utopia-BellaNaija-Weddings.04.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-recalc-dims="1" />
