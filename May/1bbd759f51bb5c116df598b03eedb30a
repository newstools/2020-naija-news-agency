Himself nd Dr barz didnt dissappoint, erigga was well below par nd i expected more from corleone. He is introducing us to afrotrap so this isnt an avenue to fail. Falz would hv killed dt track nd corleone shud hv gone harder. A remix featuring goons from africa wud b lit, Feature m.i, cassper nyovest nd sarkodie. My thoughts though‘ Peter Snipes… @facebook ‘Another failed attempt at Afro Trap‘ Bobby Ceezar… @facebook ‘am a fan of Erriga but he was whack on that tracks going off beat‘ Love Emmanuel ‘Sound like upcoming artists joint work, not even up to what am expecting‘ Cityboy Emakana ‘Never a fan of Erigga, so I wasn’t disappointed by his weak bars, Yung6ix flow was matured and we all a fan of good music can relate to that, paper tried with his delivery and the best was Dr Barz, he sounded much more like MI Abaga. Best non indigenous rap collaboration have heard this year‘ Ibeh Uche Desmond ‘Dr Barz was dope, yung6ix was super cool with that last verse, but u see payper nd erigga.. dey dissapointed me… am a big time Erigga fan.. but his verse was trash… super trash‘ Isah Emmanuel ‘To be honest, the song is below par. Especially Erigga part. Sound‘ Rueben Nkisi The post ‘Dr Barz’ Was Better Than ‘Erigga’ And ‘Payper’ On Yung6ix’s “You Don See Am”… Fans Review
