The total figure splashed out by Arsenal on what looks increasingly likely to be a solitary season of David Luiz’s services has come to light online today. The surprise deal of last summer’s Premier League transfer window saw David Luiz swap Chelsea for London rivals Arsenal. Following his 2nd stint on the books of the Blues, the Brazilian veteran made the move to the Emirates for a fee of around £8 million: Welcome to The Arsenal, @DavidLuiz_4 #BemvindoDavid — Arsenal (@Arsenal) August 8, 2019 Arsenal were known to have been on the lookout for reinforcements at centre-half throughout the summer, with Laurent Koscielny’s departure for Bordeaux having left a sizable hole at the heart of Unai Emery’s backline. Luiz, though, has since gone on to endure a typically hit-and-miss spell in the colours of the Gunners, with steady displays all-too often spoiled by the type of high-profile mistakes which have plagued the South American’s career. The first-half of the campaign in particular saw Luiz struggle in his role as an organiser in Arsenal’s backline, with the glaring deficiencies in Unai Emery’s setup having seen the former Chelsea man exposed time-and-time again. Since Emery’s dismissal, and subsequent replacement by Mikel Arteta, however, Luiz, to his credit, has improved. While the 33-year-old was never likely to represent the sort of dominant presence that Arsenal’s fans have so long been crying out for, he had, at least to some degree, begun to assert his leadership on the club’s defence before COVID-19 brought football to a halt in early March. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192160363-1024x717.jpg?resize=1024%2C717&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 05: David Luiz of Arsenal discusses with Sokratis of Arsenal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Brighton & Hove Albion at Emirates Stadium on December 05, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

After Sky Sports first suggested that Arsenal were ready to let the stopper’s expiring contract run out, Luiz followed up by reiterating his desire to secure a return to former club Benfica. If Arsenal do opt to allow Luiz to move on this summer, many have pointed to the fact that the capital outfit forked over just £8 million for the Brazilian’s signature. This, on the surface, appears far from a disaster, especially considering the inflated transfer fees of recent years. As outlined above, however, while the Gunners may have paid a minimal fee to Chelsea, the total outlay of what now looks set to be a one-year rental for Luiz has today surfaced online. And this figure is a far more significant one. As per Amy Lawrence of The Athletic, Arsenal have in fact paid a total of around £24 million for their veteran defender’s services. This can be broken down as: £8 million to Chelsea, £6 million to intermediaries who helped broker the deal, and £10 million in wages. It cost up to £24 million for a one season deal for David Luiz including all intermediary fees and add-ons. The justification for big money short term deals is very tricky now for Arsenal.
