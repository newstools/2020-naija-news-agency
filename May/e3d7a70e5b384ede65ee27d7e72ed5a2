The 31-year-old centre-back was believed to be a target for Klopp after the 2018 World Cup. Turkish outlet Fanatik and A Spor both reported that Liverpool had submitted several offers for the player after the World Cup, with Vida’s price tag in the £30m bracket. FEATURE: Pros and cons of Project Restart: Which side are you on? A move though never materialised for the defender, who was also linked with West Ham and Arsenal. Now though, according to a report from Yeni Asir, Klopp wants the experienced defender to provide cover for Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez. The article claims the player has “been hooked by Liverpool” as they look for a replacement for Dejan Lovren, who seems likely to leave Anfield this summer. The recipient of just 22 league appearances over the last two years, speculation of an Anfield exit has persistently popped up for the Croatian, who ironically is good friends with the man who could replace him, Vida. No fewer than four London clubs were recently alleged to have been interested, though a switch to Serie A appears the most likely scenario for Lovren, with a move to Roma frequently touted. That will leave Klopp with a hole to fill and if he is looking for a relatively cheap option, then a move for Vida, who is under contract until 2022 at Besiktas, could be an option.
