After the release of OVERDOSE last week, Dunnie drops her sophomore, which is a compilation of four amazing songs written, produced and engineered by her and various music creatives. According to Dunnie: "Four in the Jewish culture means Growth and a state of being. Social distancing and self isolation made me spend a lot of time with myself and I came to realize that I have grown in every aspect of myself both in artistry and as a human being. If you have followed my Journey from 7 to 4, what you will definitely hear is Growth from Dunnie." The song titles are Overdose, Koro, Ordinary and I Need You. Production Credits on includes Zaki Magic, Androbeats, Tuzi, Klasikbeats & Rome, while writing credits include Troms, MikelMizzy, Cupastonce, IduMusic, Klem, Worship, Tiwadara and Rome. The project was mixed by Mikkyme, Tiwadara & Dunnie.
