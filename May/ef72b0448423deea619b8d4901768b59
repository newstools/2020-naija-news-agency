confirmed 0, deaths 0, recovered 0 Two of Australia’s biggest tech companies, Canva and Atlassian, are looking for ways that they can help students learn remotely by bringing a bit of magic to their at-home experience and they are doing this through the 30-day “Sustainable Development Goal Challenge for Change project.” This 30-day challenge for change initiative kicked on Monday, April 28. It’s a fun, interactive way to engage with and learn from the experts in each area. Fun Fact: You could even win a few prizes along the way, so it’s well worth getting involved in. You’ll be set challenges for which you must carefully consider your solutions before finding a way to best present and share them on Twitter. Today’s challenge is on “Reducing inequality within and among countries” and is unpacked by Jamal Elsheikh, Founder of One Love Australia. *** Read it below. <img class="size-full wp-image-1407541 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Canva.jpg?resize=1415%2C792&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1415" height="792" data-recalc-dims="1" />
