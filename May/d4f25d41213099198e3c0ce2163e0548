Mrs. Osinbajo read chapters from the book, Dalu’s Diary by Ogechi Ezeji. She put a spotlight on the fiction’s themes of honesty, diligence, and adventure while taking the children on a virtual tour of Nigeria’s beautiful scenery and celebrating her culture and people. The story reading was followed by personal interaction with the children she called by name; making every child feel really special. Children asked her questions from her childhood experiences, becoming a successful woman to life as the wife of the Vice-President of Nigeria. According to her, supporting Nigeria’s number two citizen comes with great responsibility. She challenged children to embrace the future because they hold limitless possibilities. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_1024-scaled.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> It was an emotive moment after the story reading as the children chose to sing for Mrs. Osinbajo. They enthusiastically sang Timi Dakolo’s Great Nation and the National Anthem.
