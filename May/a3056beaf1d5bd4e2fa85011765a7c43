The latest reports stemming from the Spanish media today suggest that Liverpool are considering a summer swoop for struggling Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele. Jurgen Klopp’s men have of course enjoyed a historic campaign to date. Before the COVID-19 pandemic brought football in England to a halt, Liverpool had built a staggering 25-point advantage over 2nd-placed Manchester City in the Premier League table. This came with the Merseyside giants having dropped points in just 2 of their 29 league fixtures to this point in the season. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1205622330-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Liverpool’s Egyptian midfielder Mohamed Salah celebrates with teammates after he scoring his team’s first goal during the English Premier League football match between Liverpool and Bournemouth at Anfield in Liverpool, north west England on March 7, 2020.

The boys fought hard.” “We will come again, and go again. But for now, we are out.” A disappointed Jurgen Klopp is keen to not get too despondent despite the Reds losing hold of their European crown… @TheDesKelly pic.twitter.com/6f74I8jlen — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) March 11, 2020 Liverpool’s sudden dip in form, meanwhile, has since seen many highlight a lack of depth in the club’s squad. While the first-choice XI of the Merseysiders is unquestionably superb, there is a dearth of options available to Jurgen Klopp in a number of positions. One such area is in attack, where, beyond first-choice trio Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, and super-sub Divock Origi, the Reds’ options are paper-thin. As such, widespread speculation in the media over recent months has seen Liverpool tipped to address this issue with the addition of a top-class, and preferably versatile attacker. RB Leipzig standout Timo Werner has been the player most persistently-touted to fill this role, with Jurgen Klopp even rumoured to have held discussions with his fellow countryman over an Anfield switch last month. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185190978-1024x740.jpg?resize=1024%2C740&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEIPZIG, GERMANY – NOVEMBER 02: Timo Werner of RB Leipzig celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal during the Bundesliga match between RB Leipzig and 1.

As such, alternative options are now being assessed, one of whom seemingly comes in the form of Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele. As per a report from Mundo Deportivo, Jurgen Klopp is a long-time fan of the struggling Frenchman’s talents. In fact, the Liverpool boss is even said to have attempted to clinch Dembele’s signing before his Camp Nou switch came to fruition 3 years ago. And Klopp is now ready to reignite his pursuit of the former Dortmund star, with the European champions hopeful of taking advantage of Dembele’s long-standing fitness issues to clinch a cut-price deal, potentially even via a loan. Barcelona are also thought to be open to the idea of parting with their pacy wide-man, as the Blaugrana seek out funds to utilise in their chase of Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez. All of this, though, as outlined above, remains dependent on the outcome of Liverpool’s attempts to land Timo Werner.
