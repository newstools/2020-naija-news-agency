COVID19 Update(Nigeria): 
confirmed 0, deaths 0, recovered 0 Adrian Mariappa insists he has no idea how he caught coronavirus after revealing he had tested positive. The Watford defender was one of six positive results from the first round of Premier League testing this week as the top flight tries to restart. Two other members of Watford staff and Burnley assistant manager Ian Woan have also tested positive. OPINION: Disgust at Chadwick abuse proves the world is changing… Mariappa told Telegraph Sport: “Ever since I got my positive result back on Tuesday, I’ve been scratching my head to try to work out how I might have got coronavirus. “It was a big surprise because I haven’t really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids. I’ve mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit.” “I’d have preferred if everything had been kept private,” said Mariappa. “But once Watford’s name came out then my phone went mad with people asking who it was and I’m sure it was the same for all of the rest of the staff and players. “For your family, you’d rather keep it to yourself, but, unfortunately, that hasn’t been possible. It’s disappointing that rumours started, but I will just get on with things now and follow the protocols.”  We could not keep away from the camera for long so we made a Football365 Isolation Show.
