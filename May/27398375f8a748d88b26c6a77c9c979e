June 12 or June 19 have been mentioned as possible start dates, however the Premier League still need to agree on that. The vote produced a unanimous decision across all 20 clubs as Project Restart takes another step forward and resumption of 2019-20 Premier League season draws closer. Key meeting tomorrow to discuss start date, fixtures, curtailment scenarios, broadcast rebate etc @TheAthleticUK — David Ornstein (@David_Ornstein) May 27, 2020 However, while the fixture list remains up in the air, the TV broadcasters are gearing up for a festival of football. The Sun report: Armchair viewers are set for a bonanza when the Premier League returns with five matches set to be played back-to-back on each Saturday and Sunday. The first game back is expected to be a Friday night match, but after that games will be at weekends or in the traditional midweek slots. If the Sun’s report comes true, the TV-football schedule could be as follows: Saturday (5 games): 12 noon, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pmSunday (5 games): 12 noon, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 8pmTuesday (2 games): 6pm, 8pmWednesday (2 games): 6pm, 8pm <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1202995531-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 23: A general view of the Nike Merlin matchball during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Watford FC at Old Trafford on February 23, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

That leaves 45 games up for grabs when it comes to which TV station gets to air them. Unfortunately, the Times have reported this week that none of the Premier League matches are likely to be shown for free on the BBC: Moves to allow the BBC to screen some of the behind-closed-doors Premier League matches have run into stiff opposition from at least one of the pay-TV broadcast partners. As revealed by The Times previously, a draft plan would mean 32 of the remaining 45 games go to Sky, eight to BT and five to Amazon. It’s also been suggested that the likes of Sky and BT could air some of these ‘extra’ matches on their official YouTube channels.
