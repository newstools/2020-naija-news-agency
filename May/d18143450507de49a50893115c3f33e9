This Friday, May 29, our focus turns to two of the most successful record labels and greatest hitmakers in Nigerian music history: Mo'hits Records and Square Records. Mo'hits Records had a ridiculously good run back then. You could say they had the biggest artist in D'banj, the best producer in Don Jazzy, and the best singer in Wande Coal. Other stars on their roster included certified hitmaker, Dr SID, the underrated D'Prince, and KaySwitch, with Ikechukwu (Killz) joining the movement at some point. Square Records was home to Africa's biggest music duo for over a decade, P-Square. Talented singer, songwriter and dancer, May D joined them at some point and delivered some big hits as well. Between Mo'hits and Square Records, 12 full-length albums were released in an 11 year span, with 6 albums apiece. Seeing as the different projects housed multiple hits, this makes our job of highlighting only 10 songs each extremely difficult. However, we will do our best to represent each camp effectively. For Team Mo'hits, we have @demola on deck. For Team Square Records, we have @OvieO on deck. Date: This Friday, May 29. Time: 9pm (Naija Time), 4pm ET.
