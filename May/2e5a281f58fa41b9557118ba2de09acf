Sophie took to her social media page to drag ladies that have gone over the knife and still ended up looking ugly. According to her, she doesn’t care what beauty standard these days is but getting surgery to enlarge specific parts only to end up looking like a bug is not just it. Sophie advised them to demand a refund or request for a do over. She wrote: “idc what the beauty standard these days is for yall in Lagos but yall walking around looking like a bugs life. Lol, 98% of yall are botched and ya need to demand a refund or a do over because sheesh!”  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-258387" src="https://i0.wp.com/tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sophie-momdu.jpg?resize=536%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="536" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The post “Ya’ll Be Looking Like Bugs” -Davido’s Babymama, Sophie Drags Lagos Girls With Fake B*obs & A$s appeared first on tooXclusive.
