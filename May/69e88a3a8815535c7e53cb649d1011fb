The governor revealed this over the weekend when he hosted the Akwa Ibom caucus in National Assembly, who was in the state to lend their support to the state government’s fight against Covid-19. The Caucus also had embarked on a facility tour of the newly constructed 300-bed world-class Isolation Centre for Quarantine and Prevention of Infectious Diseases in Ituk Mbang. According to the governor, “in terms of boundaries, we are observing what every state in Nigeria is observing, which was agreed at the Governors’ Forum that we should restrict inter-state passenger and vehicular movements for now until announced otherwise. “However, intelligence revealed that the suspects, who are from distant states, had liaised with some of their collaborators within the state, who encouraged them to come into the state and take advantage of the robust healthcare system made available for COVID-19 suspects and patients. “I even have text messages where people were trying to communicate with their colleagues here, who were encouraging them to move into the state that here people are treated better. Guess how many they were trying to bring in? About 68 of them. So, you can imagine if they were able to come in. So by the time the intelligence got to us, we had to take appropriate steps I had to block them. In the absence of that, I think so far, the curve has declined drastically and we give God the glory and our wonderful medical team for the great job they have done in stemming the spread of the disease.” He maintained that the Akwa Ibom State Government will continue to do more to ensure a better and more robust post-COVID economy and Medicare in the state. Speaking on behalf of the Akwa Ibom Federal Lawmakers, the leader of the delegation and Senator representing Akwa Ibom North-West, Senator Christopher Ekpenyong, said the state representatives in the National Assembly were proud of the State Governor and commended his frontline leadership fight against COVID-19 in the state. Ekpenyong said the Akwa Ibom National Assembly caucus was delighted with the work on the new Isolation Centre for Quarantine and Prevention of Infectious Diseases project at the Ituk Mbang. He lauded the proactive disposition of Governor Emmanuel in healthcare delivery, adding that Governor Udom Emmanuel’s leadership of the state at this period is divinely arranged. The Lawmakers made a donation of N5 million to the State COVID-19 Management Committee, headed by the Secretary to the State Government Dr Emmanuel Ekuwem to support the great work the State Government is doing to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
