This argument, however, is actually not a new as it has been a topic of debate for over a decade and the focus has only been on two artistes, Davido & Wizkid. In an industry filled with thousands of artistes, these guys have done a remarkable job of pushing Afrobeat out of the continent and still managed to stay on top of their game. Wizkid has been keeping a low profile for a while now even after dropping “Soundman” and fans are expectant for his forthcoming album “Made In Lagos“. Despite not releasing much, the singer has remained relevant and is still one of the most talked about artiste locally and internationally. Davido, on the other hand, has been feeding his fans with music and has no plans to slow down. His album “A Good Time”  which is barely 6 months old is doing remarkably well even hit platinum in South Africa. He is also preparing for the release of another album “A Better Time” which has features from Nicki Minaj, Tiwa Savage, and Mugeez. Interestingly, another player was introduced to the game – Burna Boy. Burna has no doubt been making waves in the industry for a while but he never for once put on the same table as Davido and Wizkid. The self-acclaimed African Giant called himself the best after afrobeat king, Fela Kuti and all hell broke loose. Proud, arrogant, narcissist were the words thrown at Burna’s face but that didn’t deter him from breaking records like snagging a nomination at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards for the Best World Music Album, accumulating millions of streams and winning other awards. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics worldwide and it was included in the year-end lists issued by several publications, including Billboard, Complex, and Pitchfork. Let’s cut to the chase, these achievements further pushed Burna’s name right to the top within a short period of time so it makes sense that he would be compared to Wizkid and Davido but there can be only one king.
