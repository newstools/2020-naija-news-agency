Jose Mourinho has recently been speaking about Tottenham’s transfer situation heading into the summer. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption to sport in England over the last couple of months, with football not immune from this. The Premier League has been suspended since the 13th of March, with an official return date for the 2019/20 campaign yet to be set in stone, although, June 19th is the latest date to be floated around. With no top-flight football being played in England since mid-March, and the prospect of fans not being allowed back into stadiums until next year a very real possibility, many clubs are already feeling the financial impact of the coronavirus. Burnley stated back in early April that they could lose somewhere in the region of £50m if the campaign isn’t finished, with the Clarets set to miss out on around £5m-worth of matchday revenue from the season’s remaining home games. Even those at the top of the English game are seemingly being affected. The likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal are being reported to have been or are set to be affected by the current crisis. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1206476702-1024x701.jpg?resize=1024%2C701&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Tottenham Hotspur’s Dele Alli reacts after RB Leipzig’s Marcel Sabitzer (not pictured) scores his sides first goal of the game during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second leg match at the Red Bull Arena, Leipzig.

Spurs have had a somewhat up and down stint under the Portuguese tactician, which hasn’t been helped by injury issues and a lack of balance in the squad, especially in midfield. And with the Lilywhites also somewhat lacking back-up for Harry Kane and quality at right-back, Mourinho would have no doubt been keen to add at least a few names to his squad this summer. However, when asked about transfers on The Football Show, Mourinho admitted that it is the last thing they are thinking about: “To be honest in this moment it is the last thing we are thinking. In the club we are not thinking about it. No talks about it, because in this moment we think about safety, following every rule inside of the training ground, we are trying to be perfect, not just in the testing but in everything in the club, we are trying to be perfect. “But you ask me, and I’m not going to run away. I think it is normal that you are going to have a different market. I don’t see the world, and especially the football world, ready for some crazy numbers that we are used to having, and some crazy investments that sometimes some clubs and some leagues are used to doing. “But my first question after that is: ‘When will the transfer window be?’ Because I don’t think it will be July-August anymore, it will obviously have to go further than that.” Mourinho then went on to explain what he wants in his club: “If you ask me what I want in my club, I would like my club to be what I know it is going to be: sensible, balanced, not going to spend rivers of money, and we are trying to respect the situation, not just of football but of the world and society overall.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
