Arsenal aren’t willing to meet Barcelona’s demands for Philippe Coutinho despite their interest in the player, according to reports. The playmaker – currently on loan at Bayern Munich – is set to leave Barcelona in the summer, and a number of English clubs are thought to be interested. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs have all been linked with a move for the Brazil international. OPINION: At last, a Coutinho rumour that really makes sense… Most recently, a report claimed that Mikel Arteta ‘dreams’ of bringing Coutinho to Arsenal with the Spaniard keen to ‘make him his master at playing’. This came from Le10Sport, who add that such a ‘very expensive’ deal would prove to be ‘a complex case’ for Arsenal. And now ESPN claims that Barcelona are keen to recoup ‘more than half the £142m’ that they paid Liverpool for Coutinho’s services in 2018. Arsenal would probably be more interested in a loan deal but Barca want ‘any loan agreement to include a fee of around £10m’ with all of his huge £250k a week wages to be covered too. The Gunners along with Manchester United ‘have been offered’ Coutinho but Arsenal and rivals Tottenham would have a ‘significant problem’ paying his wages – but the report describes Chelsea as being in a ‘better position’. However, ESPN rounded off by saying that ‘no club is ready to accept Barca’s terms’ so the Catalan giants might be forced into a rethink.
