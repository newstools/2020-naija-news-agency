Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez has recently been discussing the prospect of his side winning the Champions League. The last couple of years have seen Man City completely dominate the English game. The 2017/18 campaign saw the Sky Blues secure a staggering 100 league points, the highest total in Premier League history. City would also add another League Cup to their collection that season. In the following campaign, the Citizens once again completely dominated the English top-flight, whilst also becoming the first male English side to clinch the domestic treble. Even in 2019/20, where City have fallen off in the Premier League, they have still managed to add another League Cup trophy to their ever-growing silverware collection, whilst remaining in contention to lift this year’s FA Cup. However, for all their dominance on home soil, the Manchester giants have, for the most part, disappointed on the European stage. In Pep Guardiola’s first three seasons at the Etihad, City were knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage once and quarter-final stage twice. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1191016359-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 30: Pep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City looks on prior to the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Manchester City at St. James Park on November 30, 2019 in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

Los Blancos have clinched Europe’s most coveted club prize on a staggering 13 occasions, including three times under current boss Zinedine Zidane. As a result, the City faithful were probably somewhat disheartened when they drew Madrid in this year’s first knockout round. To their credit, though, Pep Guardiola’s men put on a masterful display at the Bernabeu in the tie’s first-leg, and came away with a 2-1 victory. However, the second-leg is yet to be played, after the COVID-19 outbreak brought the majority of football around the world to a halt in March. But if the Champions League does get back underway, Riyad Mahrez is most certainly of the opinion that Man City are good enough to finally win Europe’s biggest club prize: “I think it is a good time to win the Champions League. “We have the team, we have the manager, we have everything, so it is a good time. I don’t know if we are the best, but we are good enough to win it. “The Champions League is difficult, everyone wants to win it, so it is going to be a big battle.” Quotes via Manchester City’s official website.
