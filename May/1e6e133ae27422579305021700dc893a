This song is here based on popular demand. It has been tearing up the charts currently trending on Apple Music and Audiomack (with millions of streams) and on multiple playlists on Spotify. Omah Lay’s music is deeply Afro Fusion – the melody of Wizkid meets the depth of Burna Boy. Omah would always have this to say about his music making process, “I easily weave through Afro genres but the vibe would always hit me first as Highlife, I guess it’s hugely due to the my massive highlife exposure growing up in a music family like mine.” Omah Lay writes and produces most of his records so it would be accurate to say he owns his sound. While we await his soon to drop EP – ‘GetLayd‘ scheduled for 22 May, 2020. Listen and Enjoy this impressive record “Bad Influence” self produced by Omah Lay.
