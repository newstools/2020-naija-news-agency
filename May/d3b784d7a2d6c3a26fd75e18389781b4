The five-song EP blends E Kelly’s signature sound — an airy, mellowed-out spin on Afropop — with vocals from Mr Eazi, Joeboy, Boybreed, King Perryy and Minz. Fans of Mr Eazi’s E Kelly-produced smash “Pour Me Water” will recognize the thread between that track and No Secrets’ “Need Somebody” while “My Girl” featuring King Perryy, evokes the islands with its breezy, dancehall-inspired riddim. Lead single “Confetti” featuring Boybreed is a scorching, straight-ahead afrobeat tune sure to have dancers turning up come summer. Listen to the track below: The post New Music: E Kelly feat. Boybreed & Minz – Confetti
