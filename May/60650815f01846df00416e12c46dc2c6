His testimony in court earned him leniency from charges that could have subjected him to a mandatory minimum of 37 years in prison for crimes that included orchestrating a shooting in which an innocent bystander was wounded. A U.S. District Judge ordered the release of the rapper on the 2nd of April, 2020, calling for him to serve the last four months of his two-year sentence at an undisclosed location over concerns that the rapper who has asthma, would be at risk of contracting the novel Coronavirus in federal prison. During an Instagram live session that broke Instagram records with 2 million viewers, Tekashi addressed being calling him a snitch after testifying against his gang members during the trial. He slammed those who questioned his loyalty, as he wondered where the loyalty was when his gang members were sleeping with his baby mama, beating him up and sharing the video on social media, trying to kidnap his mother and also calling a rival gang to kill him. The rapper called himself a living legend as he pointed out that many people thought it was over for him after he snitched on his gang mates. “You know why people so mad? Cause they thought it was over for me. They counted me out. Oh, yo, you ratted…it’s over for you. Y’all could never. Y’all could never cooperate with the government and come back. Y’all could never do that. I’m a living legend at the age of 24 years old.” Loyalty goes both ways: Why I snitched on my gang members to get a lighter jail sentence – 6ix9ine A post shared by  Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) on May 9, 2020 at 3:21am PDT //www.instagram.com/embed.js The post American Rapper, Tekashi 6ix9ine Finally Reveals Why He Snitched On His Former Gang Members appeared first on tooXclusive.
