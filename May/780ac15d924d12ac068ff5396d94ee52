The singer took to his Twitter page to react by reminding the dancehall singer of how she rejected his contract when he offered to help. According to him, many people thought he was stupid when he made the decision to leave his brothers. He added that his choice was the right decision as it was never about fame, money, or power but for his freedom. Peter urged Morgan never to give up as Karma would always prevail. He wrote: “And some people thought i was stupid when I made the right decision [to leave Paul and Jude]. My dear C Morgan! it’s never to late to be what you might have been. God will surely see you through and carry you through the storm. Keep believing. “My dear C Morgan, The decision I made 3yrs ago was never about the [fame],money or power! It was for my FREEDOM! Sad you rejected the contract i gave u. Just because they made you see me like the bad egg. I pray you understand that God has a purpose for everything. Never give up. The Truth shall prevail.
