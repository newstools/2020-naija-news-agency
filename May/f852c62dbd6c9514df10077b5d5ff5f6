(Buhari’s Speech)… Fellow Nigerians,
I have no doubt that by working together
And carefully following the rules
We shall get over this Pandemic
And emerge stronger in the end
Abeg, PaperBoi [Verse 1]
See Ehn, normally i be boy wen like smart girls
Fine shape, get style, come still get sense
But, who i dey with nah okpetu
Nothing the head, this one nah beta kpeku
I dey tell am the way COVID-19 bad
People wen don die and how the economy bad
But weytin dey her head nah roll the loud for me
Take me stone ground my Puna go dey proud of me
I pass am give her she light am go smoke for up
Whisper for my ear, which style you want make we fuck
Before i know my Gbola change to standing fan
Two seconds i forget weytin i been yarn [Chorus]
She say
This Puna no go soak for long,
If you know say you no wan doke make i move along
This Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along
Ehn This Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along
She say, this Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along [Verse 2]
Naija dey fuckup, weytin we nor get BVN
Make dem do bread, we see money wey people send
Money no dey, the one wey dey
Dey find himself dey rest
Problems too much, she carry my hand pam her breast
Once again i forget weytin i wan talk

Weytin sure nah to sit down fuck craze commot for this girl head
Quash her like gando, rough handle the pupu
Chop am like like pando
Quarantine sex nah blast
Go the front no worry i dey come for back
Remove her face mask
Replace am with my Gbola
W.H.O no go tell you, but e dey cure Rona abeg [Chorus]
She say
This Puna no go soak for long,
If you know say you no wan doke make i move along
This Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along
Ehn This Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along
She say, this Puna no go soak for long,
How e dey be you wan dey talk or make i move along It’s No Limits The post [Lyrics] Erigga – “Puna Vibes” appeared first on tooXclusive.
