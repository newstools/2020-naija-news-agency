The singer wasted no time taking to social media to wish his little girl a happy birthday on her big day with adorable new photos of her. Chris captioned the photos: “YOU ARE THE BEST PART OF ME!!!! DA QUEEN…. WE GOING UP….. I WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, @missroyaltybrown. But things got a lot more interesting when Chris Brown gifted his daughter a big birdhouse with pet birds which was exactly what Royalty wished for.
