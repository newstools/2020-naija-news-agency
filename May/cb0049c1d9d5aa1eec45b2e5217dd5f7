A recent report in the English media has linked Burnley’s Jeff Hendrick with Italian outfit AC Milan. Burnley would secure the services of Hendrick back in the summer of 2016 from Championship side Derby County. The Clarets are understood to have paid around £10.5m for the midfielder’s services, which was a club-record fee at the time. Since joining the Lancashire-based club, Hendrick has notched 139 appearances across all competitions, scoring 10 and assisting 7 for Sean Dyche’s side. The 28-year-old has also remained a key figure for Burnley throughout the 2019/20 season, featuring 27 times. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-904480270-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Sean Dyche during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Burnley at Selhurst Park on January 13, 2018 in London, England. Despite his central role in Burnley’s squad, though, Hendrick’s stint at Turf Moor appears to be coming to an end. The midfielder’s current contract expires next month, and according to Sky Sports News, he is yet to agree to an extension. That same report, as mentioned above, has also linked the Republic of Ireland international with a move to Serie A. As per SSN, AC Milan have shown an interest in signing the Burnley star on a free transfer. The Italian outfit are understood to have signaled their interest in Hendrick prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and are currently assessing their options ahead of the next transfer window. A number of other Premier League sides are also said to have expressed an interest in Hendrick. Burnley’s fans, though, shouldn’t give up all hope of keeping hold of the 54-time capped international beyond the current season, as Sky add that the Clarets have held initial talks with Hendrick over a new contract, and remain hopeful of maintaining his services.
