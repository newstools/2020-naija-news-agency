Everton have confirmed that Jean-Philippe Gbamin has suffered yet another injury setback. Everton secured Gbamin’s services last summer from Bundesliga outfit Mainz. The Toffees are understood to have paid around £25m for the defensive-minded midfielder. And after Everton lost Idrissa Gueye to PSG just a few days prior, Gbamin seemed liked the ideal replacement for the Merseyside outfit. However, the 24-year-old has endured a nightmare start to life in England. The Ivorian managed 45 minutes of action on the opening weekend of the season. He then played the full 90 minutes as Everton saw off Watford in their second league game of the campaign. Unfortunately for Gbamin and Everton, though, the powerful midfielder hasn’t featured since, due to injury. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195213434-1024x746.jpg?resize=1024%2C746&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 21: Carlo Ancelotti, Manager of Everton is seen in the stands prior to the Premier League match between Everton FC and Arsenal FC at Goodison Park on December 21, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

The African recently provided a positive update on his recovery, with Gbamin having confirmed that he was training with a view to returning to competitive action if the season resumes: “It is great to be back at Finch Farm with my teammates. I have my feeling back that I can get playing again.” Gbamin continued: “I am training with a view to playing this season if the Premier League returns. I feel good, fully recovered and I am ready.” However, as mentioned above, the 12-time capped international has suffered yet another massive injury setback. Everton have confirmed that Gbamin is set to undergo surgery next week after suffering a serious Achilles injury in training. And though the club are yet to state how long they expect Gbamin to be sidelined for, the BBC claim that he could be out of action for six months.
