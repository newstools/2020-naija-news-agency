A song of Worship featuring Eby Aniekwe, the second runner up of the Rock Challenge organised by Dr. Paul and PIANO RECORDS in mid 2019. “Chimo” is a reminiscence of the protection that God grants to strangers in a foreign land. Literally speaking, It extols God’s protective, keeping Grace and evokes the imagery of God’s unending, undying and unfading love for his children. His love is always demonstrated at all times, and even much more during times of tribulation when deliverance is much needed. “Chimo” is Produced by Dr. Paul, Mixed & Mastered by Sam Odus. https://tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dr.-Paul-Ft.-Eby-Aniekwe-Chimo-.mp3 DOWNLOAD MP3 Lyrics: Chimo By Dr. Paul Ft.
