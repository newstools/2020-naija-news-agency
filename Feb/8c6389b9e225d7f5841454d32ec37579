There have been petitions by party members against the congress, who had alleged irregularities and manipulation by the out-going state leadership led by Chief Dan Orbih. In the suit by Eruanga Gallant, Victor Idekheoa and Hide Obalowoshe, the claimants asked the court to restrain the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, from using the results of the wards congress for the local government congress,  scheduled to hold on Saturday. Trial judge, Justice John Okeaya-Ineh while grating the order said, “I have carefully consider the motion ex-parte before the court together with affidavit in support and affidavit of urgency with the attached exhibits, A, A1, B, B1, B2, D and E and the three address of counsel for the three applicants in this motion.
