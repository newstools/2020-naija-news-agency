Anyanacho will be going to Tokyo as the first Taekwondo female to qualify for the Olympics since Athens 2004 Olympics and second ever Nigeria Taekwondo female practitioner, after Princess Dudu, to qualify for the Olympics. According to the Nation, Nigeria’s male representative, Benjamin Okuomose, however, failed to clinch the Olympic ticket after losing 17 – 19 to former Olympic Silver medalist, Anthony Obame of Gabon.
