Jurgen Klopp admits Liverpool were “not good enough” in their 3-0 defeat to Watford in the Premier League on Saturday. Klopp‘s side were on a 44-game unbeaten run and the champions-elect were aiming to match Manchester City’s run of 19 consecutive wins – only to be on the wrong end of a humbling. Ismaila Sarr, making his first start since returning from a hamstring injury, stole the show with two goals in six minutes before he laid on the third for captain Troy Deeney – who bullied a Liverpool defence missing Joe Gomez through an injury precaution. For a team brushing aside all-comers in the league since losing at the Etihad Stadium in January 2019, Klopp’s men were second-best for almost the entire game. “They did exactly what they wanted to do, we did not. That’s how football works,” Klopp said. “The first half was a tough one, a lot of second balls, running here and there, we had the ball a lot but we didn’t come in the right positions to cross, the right positions to finish, against a really good, organised side, with a top set-up for this game. “You have to accept it, it’s not so easy, but it’s the proof we were not good enough tonight. It’s always very difficult. We have to accept if after. In the game you have to fight. We were 3-0 down but we still tried, there were no silly situations where somebody got frustrated and tried to kick someone. “If you win good, if you lose, try to do it in the right manner and do it like a man.”  For some bizarre reason, the F365 Show still hasn’t been cancelled.
