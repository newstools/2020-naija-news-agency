@olomidedidi There’s no question that Didi Olomide is a style aficionado – and her nonstop, fashionable schedule around the City of Lights is nothing short of enviable. This season, Didi took to the streets of the French capital in a variety of super chic and risk-taking outfits. Whether she’s partying it up with Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing, or strutting the streets before the show – she gave us looks that ranged from luxury athleisure to Old Hollywood vixen.
