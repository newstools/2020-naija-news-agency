The “Bolanle” singer congratulated Davido with a rather strange message that’s likely to cause on a stir on social media. He wrote, “Davido you know I love you pass Chioma! More wins God’s favorite.” While others have commended him for constantly supporting the singer, others slammed him for suing such words to congratulate the singer.
