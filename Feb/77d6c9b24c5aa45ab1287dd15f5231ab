You can not walk, you cannot talk just the way you like,
To everybody and their kids you are a superstar
And some think that you are lucky, maybe you don’t grind
And how much your racking is, some niggas don dey count
Flashlights and paparazzi everyday of your life,
It’s show business people want you to show how much you gat
Nobody cares, if you are saving you just stick to the plan [Chorus]
I’m loading money fast, when you *Rich and famous*
Don’t let the pressure weigh you down,
People don’t wanna see you frown
Camera ready everyday, anywhere and anytime, *Rich and famous*
Yeah yeah yeah, don’t say no, yeah yeah yeah,
People don’t care if it’s stormzy
They just wanna have their way, *Rich and famous*
You dine to live,
What you want and what you need, not a competition bro
People won’t let you breathe, *Rich and Famous*
I know sometimes you gonna wish to find your way,
Far away maybe to a place it’s only you and family [Verse 1]
People dey mad, elenu lo’n like
And when you dey chill, they say you dey slack
You staying lowkey, securing the bag,
Dem say you fuck up, bring the old you back
Seeing how you don’t get fitted, life is just a marathon,
Don’t forget the place you’re coming from when you hammer gan
Many other guys selling dreams that they can’t afford,
Put you under pressure make you feel like you ain’t tried enough
Vultures everywhere suck you dry they want to use your head,
Make you pay for the dreams they selling, fuck the one you get
You need a mind of your own to be fucking with them Niggas,
They just want to control your shot and say that’s my Nigga [Pre-Chorus]
You can not walk, you cannot talk just the way you like,
To everybody and their kids you are a superstar
And some think that you are lucky, maybe you don’t grind
And how much your racking is, some niggas don dey count
Flashlights and paparazzi everyday of your life,
It’s show business people want you to show how much you gat
Nobody cares, if you are saving you just stick to the plan [Chorus]
I’m loading money fast, when you *Rich and famous*
Don’t let the pressure weigh you down,
People don’t wanna see you frown
Camera ready everyday, anywhere and anytime, *Rich and famous*
Yeah yeah yeah, don’t say no, yeah yeah yeah,
People don’t care if it’s stormzy
They just wanna have their way, *Rich and famous*
You dine to live,
What you want and what you need, not a competition bro
People won’t let you breathe, *Rich and Famous*
I know sometimes you gonna wish to find your way,
Far away maybe to a place it’s only you and family [Verse 2]
Telling me this, telling me that,
Practice what you preach Nigga I don’t give a jack
I’m coming from the jungle, I don’t wanna go back
And when you don’t do what they want they say you are wack
My nigga live and celebrate the little things you get,
My nigga live if you get a roof over your head
My nigga live, thank the Lord you wake up from your bed,
At all at all dey enter pocket, when you wan chop you no beg Yea, It’s lonely at a time, ain’t no fucking cap,
Don’t know who to trust, everybody moving mad
Niggas doing drugs till they fucking die,
That’s when you know you don’t need money then you need God [Pre-Chorus]
You can not walk, you cannot talk just the way you like,
To everybody and their kids you are a superstar
And some think that you are lucky, maybe you don’t grind
And how much your racking is, some niggas don dey count
Flashlights and paparazzi everyday of your life,
It’s show business people want you to show how much you gat
Nobody cares, if you are saving you just stick to the plan [Chorus]
I’m loading money fast, when you *Rich and famous*
Don’t let the pressure weigh you down,
People don’t wanna see you frown
Camera ready everyday, anywhere and anytime, *Rich and famous*
