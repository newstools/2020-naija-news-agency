I told you I didn't want to celebrate anything on valentine's Day (love is 365) but I woke up this morning and instead, I just want to celebrate you. You are a man who is wise, who is beautiful, who is caring, who is loving, and who is a leader. You are a man who knows how to keep and nurture this peculiar treasure God has given him (me 😜). You are the perfect fit for me in every single way and I thank God for you always. I can't wait to officially be yours forever ❤️ A post shared by  Khafi Kareem (A Cup Of Khafi) (@acupofkhafi) on Feb 14, 2020 at 3:16am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js   Love you pieces… A post shared by  Ali Baba (@alibabagcfr) on Feb 14, 2020 at 3:40am PST //www.instagram.com/embed.js   Happy Valentine’s Day my love @timidakolo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ You have shown an unusual display of machismo through your support, love and care. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I love you. 🥂to all the lovers out there.
