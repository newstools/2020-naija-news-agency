Visas given to people travelling to the U.S. for temporary stay such as tourists, businessmen and women, medical treatment will not be affected. Sudanese nationals and Tanzanians will only be excluded from the diversity visa lottery and the restrictions will be effective by February 22. The administration says the ban is necessary to protect the U.S against potential acts of terrorism.
