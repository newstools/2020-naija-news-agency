The actress who wedded Lateef Oladimeji on the set of “Tomorrow is Now” last year, wondered aloud why people seem to care more about others after death rather than when alive. The actress, who must have been terribly saddened by Kobe Bryant’s sudden death cried out to people to show love to one another when it can be better appreciated and felt when alive. “I feel like people get more ‘love’ and get more ‘popular’ and get more ‘appreciated’ when they die than in their lifetime and it’s something that really hurts me, it’s something I still can’t wrap my head around. All of a sudden everyone knows that person and posting the person’s picture and writing epistles that they didn’t write in the person’s lifetime when the person could see it or read it,” wrote Adding, “let’s appreciate them as often as we can now that they are alive and can see, hear and read about everything they mean to us, because when they are gone, they no longer know what is happening here, they’ll never be able to read the epistle you post about them on social media, or hear the things you tell people about them, or know how much they made you smile and impacted you. Now is the time to do that; celebrate their birthdays, their anniversaries, their victories, be there for them when they fail, just let them know how much they mean to you.” Vanguard News The post Bad news get more attention than good ones —Juliana Olayode appeared first on Vanguard News.
