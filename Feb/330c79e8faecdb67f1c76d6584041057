Mr Adekoye Vincent, an officer in the Press and Public Relations Department of the agency, disclosed this to NAN on Friday in Abuja. Vincent, who spoke on behalf of the Director-General, Mrs Julie Okah-Donli said the agency was fully aware of the incident and was working hard through its Lagos Zonal Command to unravel the mystery about the issue. He said that the zonal command was working in collaboration with NIS to investigate the matter with a view to fishing out the real perpetrators.
