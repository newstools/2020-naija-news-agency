It was motion, fun and laughter all the way as mums and their children had loads of games, activities, competitions, raffle draws and lots more. The active toddlers were not left out as they showed their moves on the dance floor. There was also lots to eat and drink with fantastic giveaways for all attendees. It was definitely the perfect outing for a family with young children. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1386868" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Picture5-1.png?resize=983%2C603&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="983" height="603" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Huggies® Nappy Pants are designed to fit like real underwear, with a soft stretchy breathable waistband.
