He also shared a video of the incident on the internet and fans slammed the singer for his actions. However, Davido reacted to the news explaining that he was merely trying to hug him and that the attack was not intentional. Well, it appears the mother of the journalist is unhappy with the whole incident and decided to take to social media to bash the “Risky” singer.  According to her, Davido is yet to handle fame and fortune and being a gospel artiste and also a spiritual daughter to one of the big pastors in Nigeria, she advised him to read some of his books to educate himself on how to go about it. She went on to advise him to learn humility from the likes of Wizkid, Kizz Daniel, Tekno and Okey Bakassi because he clearly is still immature and has nothing compared to Dangote and other rich men.
