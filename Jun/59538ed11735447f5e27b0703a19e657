The latest word stemming from the Spanish media today suggests that some at Atletico Madrid have essentially faced up to the fact that Thomas Partey will depart the club this summer. Speculation surrounding the future of Ghanaian international Partey has been rampant of late. Amid another superb campaign to date, during which the 27-year-old has again proven himself to be one of the finest midfielders in La Liga, Partey has inevitably been linked with a move away from the Wanda Metropolitano. The likes of Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and, most persistently, Arsenal have been named as keen admirers of the African’s talents. What makes Partey’s situation such an intriguing one for interested clubs, though, is the presence of a rumoured €50 million release clause in the all-action Atleti star’s contract. With the funds available to clubs across Europe expected to be down this summer on the back of the COVID-19 crisis, and top-quality midfielders at a premium, sides in need of reinforcements in the middle of the park could do a lot worse than Partey, especially at the aforementioned price. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – March 01: Thomas Partey #5 of Atletico Madrid in action during the Espanyol V Atletico Madrid, La Liga regular season match at RCDE Stadium on March 1st 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.

And it is far from positive from an Atletico Madrid perspective. According to Cadena Cope, a number of individuals in a position of power at the Metropolitano are of the belief that Partey is set to move on this summer. The Rojiblancos are thought to have launched numerous attempts to negotiate a new deal with their transfer-linked midfielder, which would see his release clause raised significantly. However, to this point, such talks have come to nothing, leaving Atleti resigned to losing Partey ahead of next season. The Premier League is touted as the Ghanaian’s most likely destination, with Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal currently ‘best placed’ to secure Partey’s signature. Informa @RuizAntonito ”Dentro del Atlético hay una parte importante que da por perdido a Thomas. Su destino sería la Premier y el Arsenal aparece como el equipo mejor colocado”.#MercadoDeFichajes pic.twitter.com/5kR8rsKvDU — Tiempo de Juego (@tjcope) June 14, 2020 Former Arsenal stars Gilberto & Edu heap praise on Gabriel Martinelli: ‘He’s being talked about in Brazil’ Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang: Arsenal have the keys to my extension but nothing is decided Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
