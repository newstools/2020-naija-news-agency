The celebrated dancer, model, actress and pop diva delivers an audacious bop executively produced Dr. Jusin Dean layered over a thumping instrumentation that will shake-up walls and will leave listeners in a frenzy when the beat drops. “Drop” is easily a banging sonic experience, as Korra also breezes in her different vocal styling to compliment the drastic sound changes and result in a winner. “Drop” is available on all music stores and platforms.
