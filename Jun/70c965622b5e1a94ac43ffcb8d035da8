Bruno Fernandes has recently been discussing the moment that he found out he had the chance to move to Manchester United. Perhaps the most high-profile transfer of the Premier League’s latest winter window was Fernandes moving to Man United. It had been quite apparent for some time that the Red Devils’ midfield, especially with Paul Pogba sidelined, was devoid of any real creative threat. However, since United secured the services of Fernandes from Sporting CP for a fee that could potentially rise to €80m, they have looked more dangerous in the final-third. In fact, in the nine fixtures that the Portuguese standout has featured in for Man United, they have gone undefeated. Fernandes’ exploits in the month of February even led to the free-scoring midfielder picking up the Premier League Player of the Month award. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1206116777-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bruno Fernandes" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – MARCH 08: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United gestures during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Manchester City at Old Trafford on March 8, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Fernandes himself, meanwhile, is seemingly also eager for the campaign to resume. Speaking in a recent Instagram Live chat, the 25-year-old was drawn on his January move to United, with Fernandes having revealed that playing in England with United represents the ‘highest part’ of his career to date: “You know, I will say the truth that I was scared. It was a dream [come true] but it was a big dream. “For me, playing in England and for Manchester [United] was the highest part of my career. To play in the Premier League, for one of the best teams in the world. Fernandes then went on to detail the moment that he found out he had the chance to join Manchester United: “When I received the call saying: ‘Bruno, you have the chance of moving to Manchester’ I called my wife, my brother, my sister, my mother and just started crying. “But I was crying through happiness. I fought all my life for this, for this top club. The chance was here and I needed to take it with both hands, to follow my dream. “My family knew since the beginning that I wanted to be a footballer, they knew my big dream was to be in the Premier League and to play for Manchester.” Quotes via Goal.
