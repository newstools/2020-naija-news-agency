This time around, we're pairing 2 musically rich Nigerian cities: Enugu VS Port Harcourt! #NotjustokVS, while it carries the "battle" tag, is more of a celebration of our African superstars and their amazing catalogues. This Friday, June 12, our focus turns to two cities that have given us some of the greatest talents in the history of Nigerian and African music: Enugu and Port Harcourt. When you hear "042", you think of the likes of Flavour and Phyno and many more perennial hitmakers. When you hear "Pitakwa", your mind goes straight to the likes of Duncan Mighty, Timaya and Burna Boy. Of course, there are many other stars from both powerful cities. Now it's left for Team Leaders to represent the cities effectively on #NotjustokVS come Friday. For Team Enugu, we have @AfroVII on deck. For Team Port Harcourt, we have @OvieO on deck.
