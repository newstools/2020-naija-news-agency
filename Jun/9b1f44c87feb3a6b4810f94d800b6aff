This Friday, June 5, our focus turns to two of the best talents in the game right now, Kizz Daniel and Tekno. Kizz Daniel and Tekno's careers have both follow a similar trajectory in many ways. Both went mainstream dropping hits under parent record labels – Kizz Daniel with G-Worldwide and Tekno with TripleMG – and are now fronting their own imprints. Both got Next-Rated nominations in 2015 and 2016, respectively. And both have succeeded in going neck-and-neck with the likes of Wizkid and Davido in terms of bangers released in the last 5 years. The clearest distinction, however, is the fact that Kizz Daniel has TWO (2) albums to his name, whereas Tekno is yet to put out a body of work. Will this make a difference? There's only one way to find out. For Team Kizz Daniel, we have @AfroVII on deck. For Team Tekno, we have @OvieO on deck.
