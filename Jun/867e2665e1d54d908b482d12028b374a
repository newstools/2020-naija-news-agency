David Luiz’s agent has on Monday hinted that his client could, despite recent speculation in the media, still be at Arsenal next season. One of the many areas Arsenal needed to improve upon this past summer was their backline. This led to the Gunners securing the services of two centre-backs – Willian Saliba, who returned to his former club Saint-Etienne on loan for the remainder of the season, and David Luiz, who joined the north Londoners from close rivals, Chelsea. Luiz has had somewhat of a mixed debut season at the Emirates, however, to his credit, the Brazilian has looked much improved since Mikel Arteta took the reins back in late December. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1208173861-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 23: David Luiz of Arsenal reacts after conceding a goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Everton FC at Emirates Stadium on February 23, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

Sky Sports reported at the end of May that the stopper’s deal is set to expire in June and no negations over a new deal are planned. This was shortly followed by Luiz once again reiterating his desire to finish his playing career at former club Benfica, with the ex-Chelsea standout even claiming that he has spoken to the Portuguese outfit’s president concerning a return. Yet despite the signs seemingly pointing to Luiz leaving Arsenal this summer, recent comments from the player’s agent, as mentioned above, suggest the player could well be staying with the English capital for a little while longer. Kia Joorabchian started by stating his client is very happy at Arsenal before providing some detail on the option Arsenal had to extend Luiz’s contract, which has expired: “He’s very happy at Arsenal. He has an extremely good relationship with both the coach and the sporting director. He has good relationships all throughout the club, right up to the owner. He respects everybody. “Arsenal had an option, which expired. We also had a pandemic [coronavirus]. So the option expired in the middle of the pandemic. We are all very aware of that situation and we are all trying, very slowly, to get back to this ‘new normal’. “These contract situations, these renewals, if he stays or if he goes… will all sort themselves out when we get back to some kind of ‘new normal’.” The experienced international’s agent then went on to assert that Luiz will sit down with the club before the campaign resumes, before stating that there is a very high chance Luiz will be at Arsenal come 2020/21: “David will sit down with Arsenal before the season begins, have his conversations and they will both decide if he will stay or not. That will come before the season starts. The chances are very high [of Luiz being at Arsenal next season]. There is no desire to leave.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
