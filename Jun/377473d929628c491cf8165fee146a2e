The latest word stemming from the English media suggests that Liverpool are readying a bumper new contract for star defender Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk made the move to Anfield in January of 2018, after the Reds agreed to fork over a massive £75 million to Southampton. At the time, though, many called into question Liverpool’s wisdom in splashing out such a monumental sum on a player who had not yet proven himself as a consistent performer at the very top level of the game. However, to say that van Dijk has since gone on to prove his doubters wrong would be putting it lightly. The 28-year-old has, all told, been an absolute rock at the back for Liverpool over the course of his year two+ years on the books of the Reds. Van Dijk’s combination of athleticism, aerial prowess, aggression, positional awareness and poise on the ball have come together on Merseyside to see the former Celtic man develop into one of world football’s finest in his position. After guiding Liverpool to the final of the Champions League in his debut campaign at Anfield, last season saw van Dijk play an integral role in both the club’s historic Premier League title challenge, and the Reds taking the next step to secure European glory. As a result, the Dutchman was deservedly rewarded for his stellar form with the award for the PFA Players’ Player of the Year: The #PFA Players’ Player of the Year 2019 @LFC and @OnsOranje defender @VirgilvDijk  #PFAawards #POTY pic.twitter.com/BLq2TFt2vR — PFA | Professional Footballers’ Association (@PFA) April 28, 2019 Before the current campaign was halted by the COVID-19 outbreak, meanwhile, van Dijk had played every minute of Liverpool’s 29 Premier League fixtures, with the stopper of course looking set to add an English top-flight medal to his trophy cabinet imminently. Van Dijk’s consistence excellence throughout his spell at Anfield, though, has inevitably resulted in speculation that some of European football’s other heavy hitters are keen on the Dutchman’s services. Last summer saw La Liga champions Barcelona named as a potential destination, before van Dijk’s representatives made clear to the Blaugrana that the Liverpool star had no interest in seeking out a new club. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176363011-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 22: Trent Alexander-Arnold of Liverpool celebrates with teammates Virgil van Dijk and Roberto Firmino after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Liverpool FC at Stamford Bridge on September 22, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The outfit in question are PSG, with the 28-year-old said to have firmly rebuffed his latest opportunity to depart Merseyside. And, according to the Sun (via Goal), van Dijk’s continued loyalty now looks set to see the former Southampton standout rewarded financially. Liverpool are reportedly ready to offer their defensive stalwart a new 5-year contract, worth a hefty £220,000-per-week. This, in turn, would make van Dijk the highest-paid player in the storied history of the Reds.
