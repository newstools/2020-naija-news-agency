The fan believes that Wizkid’s voice alone is enough to make a change in the country. “@wizkidayo I’d be so excited if you can just drop a song highlighting some of the critical issues going on in this country. I trust and believe it will go a long way. God bless you king Crown, massive respect” The singer who has been quite vocal about issues rising in the country stated that it would be of no point. According to him, Fela made songs about bad leadership and governance and to date, nothing has changed. He urged Nigerians to pay their part in doing more so a change can occur. “Fela made songs before I was born about the issues of bad leadership and governance and even to this present administration!! my brudda nothing has changed. We gats do more”. In another post, Wizkid said we should use or voice well in the next election “Next election ! Use your voice and your votes wisely!!” Fela made songs before I was born about the issues of bad leadership and governance and even to this present administration!! my brudda nothing has changed.
