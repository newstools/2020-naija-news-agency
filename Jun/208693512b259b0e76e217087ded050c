Our attention has been drawn to the false allegations purported by Benjamin Ese and Aunty Seyitan who labeled our client, Nigerian musician Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo professionally known as Dbanj a rapist.<img src="https://i1.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/instablog9ja_20200606_30.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024" /> This is a calculated attempt to ruin Dbanj’s long-standing character and career, as well as disrupt on-going plans for his 40th birthday and album release. Not to talk of devaluing and trivializing the conversations that are currently being held to emancipate and tackle the challenges faced by the girl child. On behalf of our client D’banj, the management of DKM would like to reaffirm zero tolerance for any kind of sexual abuse and particularly frowns at any action that exploits women and the infringement of their rights. We strenuously deny the rape allegations and express our sincerest apologies to rape survivors and victims of this dastardly act. As of now, our legal team are fully involved and will address this matter with the necessary legal actions in pursuance to the full extent of the law to ensure that this malicious act of blackmail and character defamation does not occur again. We understand that this is causing huge concern. However, an internal investigation has been launched and we assure the public that we are taking this matter very seriously to establish the details. We still say NO to Sexual Violence, Racism, and Tribalism.
