One of Sheffield United’s stars has recently suggested that the new substitution rule in the Premier League may hinder the Blades in their hunt for European football. The surprise package of the 2019/20 Premier League campaign has most certainly been Sheffield United. On paper, the Blades don’t really have any outstanding talents. However, due to a combination of some creative tactics on the part of Chris Wilder and his coaching staff, and a superb work ethic throughout the club’s squad, Sheffield United have taken the Premier League by storm. In fact, as we head towards the return of the English top-flight, the Yorkshire-based club sit 7th in the table, just two points adrift of 5th placed Manchester United, whom they will overtake should they win their game in hand on Wednesday. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171630405-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 28: Chris Wilder the head coach / manager of Sheffield United during the Premier League match between Sheffield United and Liverpool FC at Bramall Lane on September 28, 2019 in Sheffield, United Kingdom.

However, as mentioned above, Sheffield United’s Chris Basham is seemingly fearful that a new Premier League rule may affect his side’s chances of securing a European spot. With no competitive fixtures played in England since March, the Premier League are doing their utmost to ensure that there is no spike in injuries when play eventually resumes. One way in which they are aiming to help players and coaches out is by increasing the number of substitutions permitted in a game from three to five for the rest of the season: For the remainder of the 2019/20 season, Premier League clubs will now be able to make substitutes instead of The maximum number of substitute players on the bench has been increased from to Full statement on these temporary rule changes: https://t.co/PKVveZclca pic.twitter.com/9B5PE404wG — Premier League (@premierleague) June 4, 2020 However, it is this rule which Chris Basham feels will put Sheffield United at a disadvantage heading into the business end of the season, as, in his words, the Blades ‘are not going to be as strong as the top six sides’: “I think the substitutes thing that has come in will affect us a little bit because we are not going to be as strong as the top six sides. “But we we are going to give it a good go and the manager would not let us do anything other than that. “The manager said we can go from just being in the Premier League, staying up, or we can go and do something we’ve never done before and that is getting into Europe and getting into the Champions League.” Quotes via the Mirror.
