An alcoholic six-year-old monkey in India identified as Kalua, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for aggressive behaviour that began when he stopped getting liquor.<img src="https://i1.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/instablog9ja_20200620_13.jpg?resize=1000%2C1000" /> This week, zookeepers at Kanpur Zoological Park charged with re-assimilating the primate for the last three years have deemed him too dangerous to live among his kind , and have sentenced him to solitary confinement for the rest of his life. According to IANS report, the alcoholic animal belonged to an ‚Äúoccultist‚Äù in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, whom local authorities believe supplied his pet with a regular diet of hard liquor and, possibly monkey meat. When the owner was found dead, they believe the neglected monkey ‚Äî likely in the throes of withdrawal ‚Äî took his aggression to the streets and began roaming the neighbourhood and attacking people, particularly the faces of women and dozens of children left needing plastic surgery after he ripped open their faces with his fangs. . Kalua had dodged animal trappers in the forests of Mirzapur for some time before finally being captured. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4f8.png?ssl=1" alt="üì∏" data-recalc-dims="1" />DailyMail Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
