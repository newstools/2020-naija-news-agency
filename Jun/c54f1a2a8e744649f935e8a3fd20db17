Ahead of Tottenham’s clash with Manchester United, Jose Mourinho has been speaking about Spurs midfielder Tanguy Ndombele. Ndombele made the move to north London last summer from Lyon. The Lilywhites are understood to have paid a club-record £53.8m to land the midfielder. This fee, coupled with the fact that Spurs have largely struggled to replace Mousa Dembele since he departed the club, put some pressure on the Frenchman. And so far, Ndombele has largely failed to impress since his big-money move. The midfielder has shown glimpses of quality, but his main issues appear to be in adapting to the physicality of the English game, and maintaining a decent fitness level. In fact, the 23-year-old has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League just twice this term. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 23: Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho looks on ahead of the Premier League match between West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur at London Stadium on November 23, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

This public criticism, coupled with his largely disappointing Tottenham stint thus far, has already led to speculation that Ndombele could be on the move in the near future, with Barcelona touted as one potential destination. However, in recent weeks, Ndombele appears to have won over Jose Mourinho. Speaking in his pre-Manchester United press conference on Thursday, the Portuguese tactician was drawn on whether or not Ndombele is ready to play the minutes that Spurs need from him. Mourinho replied by revealing that he thinks Tottenham’s record signing is now ‘much more integrated in the group’, and understands more what the club want from him: “I spent two minutes with him [during lockdown], trying to teach him how to use the Wifi GPS, nothing more than that. When he was back to the training ground, he was committed, he worked. “I can see he was much more integrated in the group, in the spirit of the group. I think he understands more and more what we want from him. “So I’m happy with his last couple of weeks where he showed us some of the great qualities that we know that he has. So yes ready for tomorrow.” Quotes via football.london.
