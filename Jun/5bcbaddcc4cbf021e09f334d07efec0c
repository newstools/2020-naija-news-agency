Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has appeared as a guest on Grant Wahl’s ‘Fútbol’ podcast this week. In the final part of the interview, the American journalist quizzed Klopp on his plans for Liverpool’s attack next season. Grant Wahl suggested that there’s often a three-year cycle in football; after that period, teams need to freshen up. Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane are about to complete their third year together as an attacking trio at Anfield. So is Klopp considering mixing up his attack in 2020-21? The German manager replied: You need to mix things… But there’s always an exception. The biggest teams in the world are always the exceptions. How long did Xavi, Iniesta and all these guys play together (at Barcelona)? They brought in, from time to time, different players like Thierry Henry. They helped, but they never really settled. That’s how it is for us as well. And for us it’s different. But our situation is also absolutely different. we get the challenges from inside the squad. If you want to buy a player like Sadio, bobby or Mo you have to pay a proper, proper price. So we have to try to build it internally. Can we play exactly the same type of football for four, five, six years? I don’t know, but I’m not that interested. The section on Liverpool’s attack in 2020-21 starts around 14 minutes into the audio unit below. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-83483309-1024x724.jpg?resize=1024%2C724&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Liverpool goalscorer Steven Gerrard (r) and Dirk Kuyt celebrate after scoring the winning goal during the Premier League Match between Liverpool and Portsmouth at Anfield on October 29, 2008 in Liverpool, England.

Gerrard has called for Liverpool to start building a statue for their German manager as soon as they win the Premier League title. Gerrard said: For me, someone like Jurgen should be rewarded now. It seems like in football we often wait until people get older before their achievements are fully recognised. But I know the owners of Liverpool won’t let that happen. When Jurgen delivers the league they should already be starting work on a statue of him.
