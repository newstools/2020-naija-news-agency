In a statement on Saturday by Director of the organisation, Prof Ishaq Akintola, MURIC said that Nigeria belonged to no particular tribe or ethnic group. The group warned Miyetti Allah against divisive, explosive and provocative statements capable of causing disharmony in the society.   	 		 	<img src="https://i2.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Prof%20Ishaq%20Akintola.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />Prof. Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC The statement reads, "We call on Miyetti Allah to confirm or deny the alleged statement. We affirm that Nigeria belongs to no particular tribe and every ethnic group has a stake in the Nigerian project. Leadership is therefore not the birthright of any ethnicity. "We appeal to Nigerians to ignore the statement allegedly made by Miyetti Allah and to allow the group to make clarifications. We call on leaders to avoid divisive, explosive and provocative statements." News    AddThis  :       Original Author  :   Saharareporters, New York     Disable advertisements  :Original Article
