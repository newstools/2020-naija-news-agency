The representative of Chelsea attacker Willian has today provided a brief update on his client’s current situation. Willian’s future has remained up in the air for some time now. The 31-year-old, who has been plying his trade at Stamford Bridge since 2013, has just a month remaining on his current Chelsea deal. The Blues are thought to have made repeated efforts to tie Willian down to new terms, but, to this point, the former Shakhtar Donetsk man has stood firm in demanding a contract through to 2024. As such, though an agreement over a short-term extension for the remaining months of the COVID-19-hit campaign is expected to be found, a subsequent divorce is beginning to look increasingly likely. A host of clubs have inevitably been touted as potential destinations for Willian ahead of next season, with the experienced Brazilian international set to be available as a free agent as things stand. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195432203-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 22: Willian of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his sides second goal with Cesar Azpilicueta and team mates during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on December 22, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

If the latest comments on the part of Willian’s agent are anything to go by, though, then a resolution over the South American’s future looks no closer to being found now than it was before the coronavirus halted football back in March. Speaking in an interview with Sky Sports earlier today, Kia Joorabchian was asked for an update on his client’s situation at Stamford Bridge. And Joorabchian appeared to hint at a Chelsea exit, suggesting that if the Blues are not prepared to offer up the terms he is after, Willian looks set to seek out a contract at another ‘high level’ club: ‘Before the pandemic occurred, the negotiations were around two and three years.’ ‘Chelsea have a policy which we respect and understand but Willian has a career and he has ambition.’ ‘He wants to finish his playing career at a very high level.’ Quotes via Goal.
