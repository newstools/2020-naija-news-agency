The draw for the semi-finals of the FA Cup was confirmed a short time ago, with 4 of England’s biggest clubs having learned their respective fates. Following a 3-month delay amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the FA Cup campaign resumed this weekend. The 4 quarter-final ties came in the form of Norwich City vs Manchester United, Sheffield United vs Arsenal, Leicester City vs Chelsea and Newcastle United vs Manchester City. And, when all was said and done, it was the favourites who emerged victories from each fixture. First, Man United put Norwich to the sword courtesy of Harry Maguire’s late extra-time winner last night. Arsenal also needed a last-gasp Dani Ceballos strike to get the better of Chris Wilder’s Blades, before Chelsea made it 3 wins from 3 since the season’s restart with a hard-fought win at the King Power Stadium. Finally, in the last of the weekend’s cup ties, holders Manchester City made short work of Newcastle, with Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling on the scoresheet. As such, 4 of the Premier League’s traditional top-6 are set to battle it out for a place in the FA Cup showpiece on August 1st. And, as outlined above, the competition’s remaining sides learned their respective semi-final fates a short time ago. Potential inner-city derbies have been avoided, with Manchester United pitted against Chelsea, and Mikel Arteta set to face off with former mentor Pep Guardiola when Arsenal take on Man City. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1147391977-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – MAY 06: Josep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City in discussion with assistant Mikel Arteta during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Leicester City at Etihad Stadium on May 06, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.
