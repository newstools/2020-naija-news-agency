Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez has opened up on his early struggles with the club. The 2015/16 campaign saw Leicester City cause a huge upset. The Foxes went from fighting off relegation the season prior to clinching their first-ever Premier League title. One of the driving forces behind Leicester’s success that season was Riyad Mahrez. And after a couple of further impressive seasons at the King Power, the Algerian was eventually snapped up by Manchester City in the summer of 2018. The Citizens are understood to have paid a then-club-record £60m for the winger’s services. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1177860623-1024x703.jpg?resize=1024%2C703&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 28: Riyad Mahrez of Manchester City during the Premier League match between Everton FC and Manchester City at Goodison Park on September 28, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

City would clinch the domestic treble last term, earning a staggering 98 points in the Premier League, but Mahrez wasn’t really a star performer. The now 29-year-old scored seven and assisted four in the league over the course of the season, but it was quite clear that Pep Guardiola didn’t trust Mahrez in key outings, with the African’s game time having dropped off considerably over the campaign’s final weeks. This term, though, has seen the 57-time capped international improve greatly. Mahrez has been a regular starter in the Premier League, with the former Leicester man having chipped in with seven goals and ten assists. And now, as mentioned above, Mahrez has opened up on his early struggles at the Etihad: “At City, the team is built to win every game. We try to win everything we’re playing for. “Last year, when I arrived, the manager trusted me and believed in me, but I didn’t make the difference as quick as they thought I would. At a club like City, they don’t have time to wait. “There are 20 top players, so I was on the bench when others were performing so it was a bit difficult for me to come back. But I played well towards the end of the season, and I started this season differently. “When I’ve played, I’ve been performing so the confidence is here.” Mahrez also discussed how he was forced to adapt his style of play when he joined Man City, due to teams sitting deeper versus the Citizens: “When I arrived at City, I noticed how everyone sits back so you have to think differently. “You have to deal differently with your opponent, and in my case the left-back because he’s always in front of me. They also always have help around him, with a midfielder or the winger, so you have to change your play and your movement. “You have to adapt to this… it took me a little bit of time but now I feel I’m set up very well.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
