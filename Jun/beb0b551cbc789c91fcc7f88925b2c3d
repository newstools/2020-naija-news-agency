The latest word stemming from the Spanish media suggests that Arsenal have set their sights firmly on the signature of Atletico Madrid star Thomas Partey. Amid another largely-disappointing campaign to this point, Arsenal are expected to be active on the transfer front upon the reopening of the market over the coming months. Before the COVID-19 pandemic brought football across Europe to a standstill, the Gunners sat 9th in the Premier League table. The capital giants were also ousted from the Europa League in heartbreaking fashion by Greek outfit Olympiacos late in February, on the back of a late collapse. As such, another season without Champions League football looms large for Mikel Arteta’s men in 2020/21. The prospect of missing out on a spot in Europe’s top-tier competition once again, meanwhile, has led to inevitable rumours that some of the club’s top talents could be on the move this summer. The key name to have been tipped for an Arsenal exit to this point has been Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who, amid another fruitful campaign in front of goal, has been persistently-linked with La Liga champions Barcelona. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1191153156-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s Spanish head coach Mikel Arteta (R) speaks with Arsenal’s Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (L) during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 1, 2020.

As a result, if, as expected, a number of players do eventually depart the Emirates ahead of next season, Mikel Arteta’s paper-thin squad will be stretched to its limits. Such a scenario, though, would no doubt also see a host of new faces arrive in north London over the months to come. One such player to have been persistently touted as a potential addition to the Arsenal cause this summer, meanwhile, has been Thomas Partey. Atletico Madrid star Partey has developed into one of La Liga’s standout midfielders over the last couple of seasons, with Gunners boss Arteta known to be a keen admirer. And, as outlined above, if the latest speculation in the Spanish media is to be believed, then Arsenal look ready to focus the club’s full attentions (and potentially resources) on their pursuit of the Ghanaian. As per a report from Mundo Deportivo, Partey has been identified as the north Londoners’ ‘priority objective’ this summer. The 26-year-old’s Atletico contract contains a €50 million release clause which the Spanish giants have long been keen to renegotiate, so, if Arsenal genuinely hope to lure Partey to the Emirates, they will likely need to do so this summer, or risk being priced out of a move. Though a formal offer is not thought to have been forthcoming as of yet, the board at the Emirates remain ‘attentive to the situation’ surrounding negotiations between their no.1 target and Atletico, with the capital outfit waiting in the wings should talks collapse. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – March 01: Thomas Partey #5 of Atletico Madrid in action during the Espanyol V Atletico Madrid, La Liga regular season match at RCDE Stadium on March 1st 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.

Speaking during a recent interview with Citi TV, as cited by Mundo Deportivo, Attamah suggested that the time has come for Ghana’s star man to test his talents in a new country, explaining: ‘I will be happy if he goes to Arsenal. He has done everything at Atlético and is recognized as one of his best players.’ ‘He also has to go to a different league to prove himself. He needs people to know that he is capable of succeeding in other places and not only in Spain.’ Chelsea ready a £75m bid for Kai Havertz, Man United also in mix & optimism over N’Golo Kante’s possible return Adam Lallana set to agree Liverpool extension as Leicester circle & concerns over how Takumi Minamino is settling Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
