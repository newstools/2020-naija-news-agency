A potential landing spot for soon-to-be out of contract star David Silva has been reported on in the English media recently. When the curtain finally draws on David Silva’s Man City career, the Spaniard will no doubt be remembered as one of the club’s and perhaps the Premier League’s all-time greats. Silva, now 34, joined the Citizens almost a decade ago from La Liga outfit, Valencia. During his time at the Etihad, the World Cup winner has been an absolutely integral member of the Sky Blues’ side. In total, the Valencia youth has notched 424 appearances across all competitions for Man City, scoring 74 and assisting 137 along the way. Silva has also helped guide City to a plethora of trophies, including four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1058681994-1024x689.jpg?resize=1024%2C689&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 07: David Silva of Manchester City celebrates after scoring his team’s first goal during the Group F match of the UEFA Champions League between Manchester City and FC Shakhtar Donetsk at Etihad Stadium on November 7, 2018 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Silva confirmed last year he will depart Man City when his contract expires at the end of the current season. And whilst the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused fears Silva wouldn’t actually be able to play out the current campaign, as his contract runs out at the end of June, there seems to be confidence that the tricky midfielder will sign a short-term deal in order to finish the campaign. Beyond that though, Silva’s next career move is still somewhat up in the air. Silva has previously been linked with a return to former club Valencia, with the MLS also touted as a potential landing spot for the City legend. Now though, as mentioned above, a fresh destination for Silva has been reported on recently. According to a piece from the Mirror, on Sunday, Silva is being offered a lucrative move to Qatar this summer. The report goes on to claim that Al-Duhail, who are currently top of the Qatar Stars League, have told Silva’s representatives they are willing to blow any rivals for the midfielder’s signature out of the water when it comes to the financial package on offer.
