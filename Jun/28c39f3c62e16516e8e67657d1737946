We have heard about neighbouring countries that opened and shut. We have heard about cases spiking with children getting into school. Of all the things I will like to do, I will not like to experiment with your children.“We want a situation where once we are sure it is safe, we can then take them into school.“I had a meeting with the representatives of WAEC and NABTEB and I understand how that worries our parents at the moment and how anxious our children are to know what next.“As soon as those in charge of the blockade lift it because there is no way we can open our schools if teachers can’t come. So, we are looking at somewhere after the interstate lockdown is lifted. Because we will need that kind of openness for the children to move.” Education  PUBLIC HEALTH    News    AddThis  :       Original Author  :   Saharareporters, New York     Disable advertisements  :Original Article
