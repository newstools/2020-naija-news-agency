A little over six months since his introduction, B2Rap is offering the “God In The Trap House (EP),” a mixed-flavor of Christian and Trap/Hip-Hop culture, combined with a vision to speak to the world through music, all done in a bid to inspire the world and younger generations with his music and speaking the truth, a goal which has been his priority and philosophy of life; with productions from WizzyPro and Frankie Free, the eight track EP offers subtlety and finesse in all accords – listen up and share your thoughts. | ENJOY!!! <img src="https://i0.wp.com/tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/B2Rap-God-In-The-Trap-House-EP-Back-Artwork.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Purchase “B2Rap – God In The Trap House (EP)” via Digital Stores CONNECT WITH “B2Rap“Twitter: @b2rap1Instagram: b2rap The post B2Rap – “God In The Trap House” (EP) appeared first on tooXclusive.
