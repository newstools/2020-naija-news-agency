Momentum is starting to build over Chelsea’s activities in the next transfer market. On Tuesday, the Athletic reported that Roman Abramovich is willing to fund two marquee signings in the off-season. One player on Chelsea’s radar is Leicester City left-back Ben Chilwell, while the Athletic also confirmed that the Blues are in the market for a forward. Today, the Telegraph have claimed that Chelsea are considering an audacious move to sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal. Readers are told: Chelsea also retain an interest in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Chelsea realise it could be difficult to do business with Arsenal over the 30-year-old. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192950708-1024x697.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 09: Nicolas Pepe of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his sides second goal with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during the Premier League match between West Ham United and Arsenal FC at London Stadium on December 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) The Telegraph have echoed earlier reports from ESPN’s Julien Laurens that Chelsea are interested in Arsenal’s Aubameyang. ESPN have previously announced: Chelsea are monitoring Aubameyang’s situation, sources have told ESPN, as they look for a new centre-forward. It feels clear that Arsenal have a major problem on their hands regarding Aubameyang. Aubameyang only has one year remaining on his current Gunners deal, and it’s unclear whether he’s interested in signing a new deal. If Aubameyang decides to leave Arsenal, he could possibly agree to join a new club as early as January 2021. This season, Aubameyang has scored 21 goals in 30 games for Arsenal. He’s the club’s top scorer. Over the past few days, Arsenal’s difficulties in agreeing a contract extension with Aubameyang have become clear. Firstly, there’s huge confusion over whether Arsenal have even offered Aubameyang a fresh deal. That beggars the question, what are the Gunners waiting for? Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has received a contract extension offer from Arsenal, according to L’Équipe. — Get French Football News (@GFFN) June 1, 2020 Arsenal have not offered Aubameyang a new deal. @ESPNFC — Julien Laurens (@LaurensJulien) June 1, 2020 In addition, the Telegraph reported on Tuesday that Mikel Arteta is taking matters into his own hands regarding the Aubameyang situation. While some Gunners fans may have been buoyed by that report, others may see it as another sign that Arsenal’s transfer strategy is all over the place. It’s worth noting that quite a few recent players have turned out for both Arsenal and Chelsea in recent memory. Those players include Cesc Fabregas, Olivier Giroud, Petr Cech, William Gallas, Ashley Cole, Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Lassana Diarra and Yossi Benayoun. Returning to Chelsea’s interest in Aubameyang, it should be noted that the Telegraph suggest that the Gabonese striker isn’t Frank Lampard’s main target. Instead, Chelsea are preparing to battle Liverpool over Timo Werner’s signature: Chelsea are plotting a move to try to snatch Red Bull Leipzig forward Timo Werner from under the noses of Liverpool. Elsewhere, Lyon’s 23-year-old striker Moussa Dembele is also name-dropped as a possible Blues target. While, the Telegraph also report that back in January, Chelsea tried and failed to sign Edinson Cavani from PSG. With Cavani set to become a free agent at the end of this month, could Chelsea opt for the veteran Uruguayan instead?
