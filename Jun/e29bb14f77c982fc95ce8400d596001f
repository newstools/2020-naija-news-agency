Abdulgafar Ijaya, a professor of economics, University of Ilorin, stated this at the 2020 virtual celebrations of Federation of Muslim Women’s Association in Nigeria (FOMWAN) Week held in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. The celebration was themed “Empowering Communities in Results-Oriented Project to Enhance Sustainable Development”. Ijaya pointed out that  a true empowerment programme encompasses four layers – economic, social, political and psychological empowerment.
