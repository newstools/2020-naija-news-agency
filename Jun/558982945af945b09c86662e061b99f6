A recent report from the Telegraph has provided some insight into Manchester City’s potential plans to replace Leroy Sane. Sane has been on City’s books since the summer of 2016, after departing German outfit Schalke. And the electrifying winger has since gone on to form a crucial part of the Sky Blues’ lethal attack, notching over 100 appearances, whilst helping guide Man City to a plethora of silverware. However, the 24-year-old’s future at the Etihad has been up in the air for some time now. German powerhouse Bayern Munich were said to have been weighing up a formal bid for Sane back in August of 2019, but the winger’s ACL injury put an end to such speculation, With Sane having now recovered, though, it seems that the Bundesliga giants are once again circling, with reports back in May having gone as far as to suggest that Bayern had lodged a £35m bid for the winger. And though the City faithful may still have held out hope that their side could maintain such a top talent, Sane himself is now also said to be keen to end his stay in Manchester. The winger has just a year left on his current Man City deal, with Pep Guardiola having recently confirmed that the Citizens will either sell Sane this summer, or part with him for free next year. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159508792.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 04: Leroy Sane of Manchester City reacts to an injury during the FA Community Shield match between Liverpool and Manchester City at Wembley Stadium on August 4, 2019 in London, England.

However, if the aforementioned report from the Telegraph is to be believed, then the Manchester powerhouse are still making some contingency plans for a potential Sane exit. It is reported that, in the event Man City receive their asking price from Bayern for Sane, then they will consider a move for Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish. Grealish has enjoyed a sensational season, despite Villa’s woes, with City’s neighbours, Manchester United, also heavily linked with the Englishman. Given the fact that Grealish can play in numerous positions across an attack, including on the left and as a central attacking midfielder, though, he could prove the perfect signing for City, as the 24-year-old would help to fill the void left by both Sane, and the departing David Silva.
