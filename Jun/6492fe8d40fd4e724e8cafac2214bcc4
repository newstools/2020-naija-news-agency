Arsenal loanee Dani Ceballos has confirmed that he maintains a ‘very good’ relationship with manager Mikel Arteta, but also reiterated his desire to return to and succeed with Real Madrid. Spanish midfielder Ceballos joined the Gunners last summer, on a season-long loan. The highly-regarded 23-year-old was brought to the Emirates as a replacement-of-sorts for Aaron Ramsey, who of course departed north London for Italian giants Juventus following the expiration of his contract. And, though Ceballos was fresh off the back of a difficult campaign with Real, his signing was nevertheless viewed as quite a coup for Arsenal.

While he has managed to showcase his unquestionable quality on occasion, with starring performances versus the likes of Burnley and Bournemouth, all told, Ceballos has simply failed to make the kind of impact at the Emirates that fans would no doubt have hoped for. In fact, through a combination of injury struggles, competition for places and general inconsistencies, the former Real Betis man has notched starts in just 10 of Arsenal’s 28 Premier League fixtures. To his credit, before the campaign was halted, Ceballos had reclaimed his place in Mikel Arteta’s midfield, but the COVID-19 outbreak swiftly put an end to the 23-year-old’s return to form. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1201357290-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 16: Dani Ceballos of Arsenal reacts during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Newcastle United at Emirates Stadium on February 16, 2020 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by James Williamson – AMA/Getty Images) As such, for some time now, it has remained altogether unclear what Arsenal’s plans for Ceballos entail. The Spanish international, on his day, is a genuine difference maker, but unfortunately for Ceballos, he has simply been unable to showcase such a level on a consistent basis during his time in England. As outlined above, though, if the 23-year-old’s latest comments are anything to go by, then Arsenal’s intentions for Ceballos beyond this season appear to be irrelevant. This comes with the midfield talent having this week moved to reiterate his firm desire to carve out an extended future for himself with parent club Real Madrid: ‘I have not spoken to Zidane, he is now focused on his players,’ Ceballos explained during an interview with Onda Cero. ‘When my loan contract ends I will be a Real Madrid player again. My goal is to succeed there.’ Ceballos was also keen, however, to assure that he remains fully committed to the Arsenal cause for the time being, having struck up an excellent relationship with Gunners boss Mikel Arteta: ‘I had to be away for a long time due to injury but I worked hard to turn the situation around.’ ‘With Arteta, I have had a very good relationship since he arrived, he has given me confidence and now I am focused on ending the season in the best possible way and achieving our goals.’ Premier League clubs given ‘green light’ to hold friendlies ahead of season’s return Mikel Arteta to ‘take matters into his own hands’ to keep hold of Aubameyang/Arsenal yet to table contract offer Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
