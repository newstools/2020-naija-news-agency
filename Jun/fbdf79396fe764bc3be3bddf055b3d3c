Last week, Ben Ayade announced the mass production of face shields have begun for students in the state so that they can resume school, observing necessary COVID-19 protocols. In a joint statement signed by its Chairman, Agam Ayuk, and Secretary, Ezoke Epoke, on Saturday, the statement reads in parts, as provided by Punch: The declaration by the Cross River State Government of a trial resumption of three public schools in each of the three senatorial districts in the state on June 16, 2020, is alarming. To the medical community, there is a lack of evidence to ascertain the actual COVID-19 status and disease burden in the state due to the unacceptable low number of tests carried out. The quick resumption of schools, despite genuine reasons, has the potential of significant disease outbreak among pupils. The association advocates the adoption of educational technologies to provide remote learning opportunities and educational programmes for pupils in public schools in the interim, which is currently being implemented by private schools until a national policy is introduced on the unified resumption of schools by the Federal Government. *********************************** 269 stranded Nigerians in India successfully arrive in Nigeria on, Saturday, June 13, 2020.
