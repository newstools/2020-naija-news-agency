Skales, Jay Rox & Scott Innovative Zambian rapper, Chanda Mbao, has released the video for “The Final Wave,” the last addition to his trap-leaning cross-continental canon singles. “Wave,” originally released in Zambia, had R&B talent, Scott, on the earlier version and turned out to be a breakaway hit in Southern Africa spawning a remix dubbed "The Bigger Wave" featuring South African and Mozambican heavyweights, Da L.E.S and Laylizzy. SEE ALSO: Justice Bangura – Sound In Motion (EP) The newest and closing version of the series titled "The Final Wave" brings it to west Africa, Nigeria specifically, to add some of the sub-region’s famous tonality to the already strong hip-hop influence. Skales adds a suave, melodic verse that fits right at home alongside Chanda Mbao’s and Jay Rox’s as Scott retains hook duties.
