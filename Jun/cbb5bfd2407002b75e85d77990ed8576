This is one episode fans have been looking forward to. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu sat with two controversial ladies of the Pepper Dem edition, Mercy and Tacha. They tried to iron out their differences, but it didn’t quite have the sparks like their fans expected it would. The good thing is this was their longest face-to-face conversation since they left the BBNaija house, but did it yield a good result? Who else would like to know what’s happening/what happened between Tacha and Mercy?#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 As you know, these ladies have a really strong fan base, and just maybe their fans are making it seem like there is no love lost between them. Tacha disclosed on the show that before the disqualifying fight, she had congratulated Mercy on securing immunity while they were both in the bathroom. Things, however, blew out of proportion after Cindy uttered a triggering statement. Tacha admitted to letting her agitation from being up for possible eviction at a crucial time, get the best of her. Mercy says in “real life” they say they’re cool, but she finds Tacha being antagonistic towards her on social media.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Have the Titans and Mercenaries gotten into the heads of Tacha and Mercy? Ebuka is asking.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Since the BBNaija Show ended in 2019, there has always been a clash on twitter between the Titans and Mercenaries, but during their chat on the Reunion Show, the duo is actually cool. They exchanged calls a few times. They talk on the phone, guys. They call each other.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Although Mercy said she blocked Tacha because she was constantly trolling her on social media, of which she has receipts, but in Tacha’s defence she never did, and her social media platforms aren’t operated by her. Tacha says she tried to follow Mercy but saw that she was blocked. This was in 2019.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Both of them have receipts. Tacha of her being blocked by Mercy, and Mercy of subs by Tacha.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Tacha is stating it explicitly that she has never thrown a shade at Mercy.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Tacha said, “I suggested that Mercy and I went live on Instagram to make our fans believe we are cool, Mercy replied, “If we can have this discussion behind the camera, I will believe you”. Mercy wants them to have this discussion/reconciliation away from the cameras. She wants a Mercy/Tacha heart-to-heart.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Tacha and Mercy may be on the path to mending their relationship. The duo admitted that they need to get their relationship fixed and let their fans know they are in good terms. Both of them are very open to having a conversation and mending fences. They’ve both been so straightforward and honest. So cool to see.#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Ebuka thinks the two of them being cool would be so powerful for their brands. What do y’all think?#BBNaija #BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM — BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 17, 2020 Everyone is certainly looking forward to this!
