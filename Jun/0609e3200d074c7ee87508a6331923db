Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was today drawn on the possibility of Alexis Sanchez returning to play a role for the club next season. Chilean international Sanchez made the move to Manchester in January of 2018, on the back of a scintillating stint with Premier League rivals Arsenal. To say that the 31-year-old’s time at Old Trafford subsequently proved disappointing, though, would be an understatement. Sanchez, simply put, failed to deliver in any way, shape or form in a Red Devils jersey. All told, last season saw the experienced South American notch a paltry 2 goals across all competitions. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1141474938-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Alexis Sanchez" data-recalc-dims="1" /> HUDDERSFIELD, ENGLAND – MAY 05: Alexis Sanchez of Manchester United down injured during the Premier League match between Huddersfield Town and Manchester United at John Smith’s Stadium on May 5, 2019 in Huddersfield, United Kingdom.

As such, it came as little surprise when the former Barcelona man’s departure was made official last August. Sanchez joined Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan on loan for the 2019/20 campaign, reuniting with Romelu Lukaku at the San Siro: | EVERYONE STOP @Alexis_Sanchez is a Nerazzurri player! https://t.co/4mJAFMukTV#WelcomeAlexis #NotForEveryone #FCIM pic.twitter.com/zJ0jyuhG99 — Inter (@Inter_en) August 29, 2019 The attacker’s time in Milan, though, has since also proven a major disappointment. Sanchez actually enjoyed a decent start to life in the Nerazzurri jersey, notching a goal and an assist across his first 4 appearances. However, just when he appeared to be getting things back on track, a serious injury picked up whilst on international duty in October saw Sanchez confined to the sidelines. The 31-year-old damaged ankle ligaments during a friendly meeting between Chile and Colombia, an injury which has restricted him to just a pair of Serie A starts. | ESAMI Accertamenti clinici e strumentali per @Alexis_Sanchez: il comunicato  https://t.co/0Z09tcBLiJ #FCIM pic.twitter.com/1D6zzeHNRN — Inter (@Inter) October 15, 2019 As such, despite recent reports to the contrary, the widespread assumption has long been that Inter will opt against attempting to make Sanchez’s arrival permanent, with the veteran set to return to Old Trafford for the 2020/21 season. And, as outlined above, the possibility of Sanchez linking back up with his squad this summer was today put to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Speaking in an interview with The Star, the Manchester United boss was drawn on the on-loan attacker’s potential role with the club next season, with Solskajer having been rather cryptic in his response. After first assuring that there will always be room for ‘good players’ at Old Trafford, the Norwegian also appeared to hint that Sanchez perhaps ‘doesn’t go’ with the rest of his Red Devils squad: ‘Of course there’s a place for good players and good people in this environment.’ ‘Let’s see where we get to after the season, because we do feel this squad is exciting. We do feel we’re on the way to something.’ ‘It’s up to all the players when they’re here to do well, because there’s always talk of people coming in and out, and it’s about gelling this group together.’ ‘Sometimes when you decorate your living room it might be a nice chair or nice sofa, but it maybe doesn’t go with the rest of it.’ ‘For us to think about major honours, our focus is about finishing the league this season.’ Solskjaer backs Dean Henderson to become Man United & England’s No.1 ‘at some point’ Man United ‘close’ to agreeing new deal with Chelsea-linked Angel Gomes/Youngster training with first-team ahead of PL’s return Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
