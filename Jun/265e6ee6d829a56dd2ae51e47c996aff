Frank Lampard has recently discussed his hopes of freshening the current Chelsea squad with some new additions. Despite his very limited experience in the dugout, Frank Lampard was the man chosen by Chelsea to replace the outgoing Maurizio Sarri last summer. And whilst Sarri wasn’t exactly a fan favourite at the Bridge, he still managed to guide the Blues to a 3rd-place finish in the Premier League whilst also winning the Europa League. But unlike Sarri, Lampard, who was already bereft of any top-flight managerial experience, would be unable to call upon star man Eden Hazard due to the Belgium making the switch to Real Madrid over the summer. The former Derby County boss was also unable to bring in any of his own additions during his first transfer window due to the capital giant’s transfer ban. Yet despite losing their star player and not signing anyone for two windows, Lampard and co. have had a fairly successful 2019/20 to date. In fact, before the season was halted, Chelsea were sat 4th in the PL, a position they have managed to hold for the majority of the campaign. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea gives his team instructions during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Lampard’s focus on youth has showcased the amount of previously neglected quality in Chelsea’s ranks. The likes of Tammy Abraham, Reece James and Fikayo Tomori have had sensational 2019/20’s and will no doubt continue to impress, providing they are afforded a decent number of minutes going forward. Yet whilst the Chelsea faithful will be glad to see their academy products finally utilised, it is fairly clear the Londoners are still some way away from challenging the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool in the league and competing with the very top in Europe. As a result, Chelsea will likely be eager to add some reinforcements in the near future, especially with Willian and Pedro’s contracts expiring this month. And as mentioned above, it seems as though Lampard is also hoping to breath some new life into his squad. Speaking in a recent interview, the English tactician stated he is excited about the squad he has at his disposal, but Lampard also conceded he wants a few additions for certain areas: “I’m certainly excited about the squad we’ve got, with the young players and if we can get a few additions for areas I feel we need. “We didn’t bring in anyone in January, it didn’t work out to be right for us at the time, and last summer we couldn’t bring anyone in, so those windows are gone and we haven’t changed. “So I am excited about the squad we’ve got, if we can freshen up in the right areas we all know that.” Quotes via Goal.
