The pace is picking up on Tuesday… On Monday night, the Daily Mail linked Chelsea with a possible move to sign Bayer Leverkusen playmaker Kai Havertz. The Mail’s report used terms such as “plot” and “will attempt” to describe Chelsea’s interest in the 20-year-old playmaker. However, according to the Guardian, Chelsea have actually begun talks with the Bundesliga side over the possible summer transfer. Chelsea want Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen as part of summer spree. By @JacobSteinberg https://t.co/QlGrRlYxn5 — Guardian sport (@guardian_sport) June 9, 2020 Here’s what the Guardian’s Jacob Steinberg has revealed: Chelsea have contacted Bayer Leverkusen about signing Kai Havertz this summer… (Chelsea) have held early talks with Leverkusen. What’s clear is that these talks are at an early stage. However, the Guardian flag up that Havertz’s price tag is already a central focus of the discussions: Arranging a deal for Havertz is unlikely to be easy, with reports in Germany suggesting Leverkusen could hold out for as much as €100m (£89m) for a player who has scored five goals in four games since the Bundesliga resumed last month. (Chelsea) would hope to negotiate a fee in the region of £70m. That issue isn’t touched upon in the Guardian’s update. However, one would have to assume that Havertz would likely snub a possible move to Stamford Bridge if Chelsea fail to qualify for the Champions League. The Guardian also note that Chelsea face competition. Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Real Madrid are listed as alternative suitors, although it’s unclear if any of these clubs have started talks with Bayer. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1144056602.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DOETINCHEM, NETHERLANDS – MAY 15: Hakim Ziyech of Ajax during the Dutch Eredivisie match between De Graafschap v Ajax at the De Vijverberg on May 15, 2019 in Doetinchem Netherlands (Photo by Erwin Spek/Soccrates/Getty Images) It’s sizing up to be a busy summer at Chelsea. The Blues have already signed Hakim Ziyech from Ajax, while Timo Werner’s arrival from RB Leipzig seems to be certain too. Paper reports continue to link Leicester’s Ben Chilwell to the Blues, while the Kai Havertz story seems to be gathering pace. If that wasn’t enough, the Guardian also note that Chelsea have an interest in Brentford winger Saïd Benrahma. The Algerian news outlet, La Gazette du Fennec, linked Chelsea to Benrahma back in May. Those signings are likely to be evened out by outgoings at Stamford Bridge this summer. Pedro, Willian, Emerson Palmieri, Michy Batshuayi, Jorginho, Ross Barkley and Marcos Alonso cold all leave the club.
