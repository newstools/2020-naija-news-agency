Earlier in the week, the Athletic reported that Chelsea will try to sign Ben Chilwell from Leicester City before the start of next season. Frank Lampard has rotated between Marcos Alonso and Emerson Palmeiri at left-back this season. Even Cesar Azpilicueta has played in that slot on occasion. Meanwhile, Leicester’s Chilwell has impressed playing 23 times for the Foxes in the Premier League. He’s scored twice and chipped in with three assists. 23-year-old Chilwell is under contract at the King Power Stadium until 2024, while the Athletic revealed he’s Chelsea’s “first choice target”. Yet, signing Chiwell from the King Power won’t be easy. Readers were told: Chilwell will not be cheap as his current contract still has four years left to run. There were suggestions earlier this year that the England international was valued by Leicester at £85 million but Chelsea think the impact of the virus will help lower the fee. On Wednesday, in the latest edition of the Transfer Window Podcast, the Chelsea-Chilwell story is given the seal of approval by reporters Duncan Castles and Ian McGarry. They confirmed that Chelsea’s interest in Chilwell is “concrete” and, perhaps more importantly, it’s claimed that the left-back is keen on moving to Stamford Bridge.

(Photo by Stephen White – CameraSport/Getty Images) Reporter Ian McGarry has claimed that Chilwell has already “explained his situation” to manager Brendan Rodgers, in a sign that he’s “very attracted” to completing a move to Chelsea. But why would Chilwell want to leave the Foxes for the Pensioners? Leicester are 3rd in the Premier League on 53 points, while Chelsea are 5 points behind them in 4th. Ian McGarry claimed that one of the reasons Chilwell is keen on the switch to Chelsea is because Ashley Cole has been convincing the Blues to make a move for him. Cole is a youth coach at Chelsea, while he’s previously spoken openly about his admiration for Chilwell. “There’s always going to be a question mark going to a bigger club, but he’s doing really, really well. “He’s obviously enjoying the way Brendan plays, and the system, he’s got that licence to attack. In terms of quality, for sure he has the quality to be here.” – Ash Cole. — Simon Phillips (@SiPhillipsSport) June 3, 2020 So will Chilwell actually leave Leicester? According to the Transfer Window Podcast, while the Foxes would like to retain their left-back, they are being “pragmatic” about the likelihood of a sale. In reaction, Leicester are now considering making a move to sign Kieran Tierney from Arsenal. Of course, Tierney used to play for Brendan Rodgers at Celtic.

The Scottish international has been reduced to only 5 Premier League appearances in his debut season with the Gunners due to injury problems. Arsenal signed Tierney in a 25 million pound deal last summer. The defender is under contract until 2024. Would the Gunners consider selling him just 12-months later? The Leicester, Chelsea, Chilwell, Tierney conversation kicks in after 26 minutes. Also see: At least 37 Covid-19 deaths linked to Manchester United vs Man City.
