For Tuesday‚Äôs show, Tacha, Mercy, Venita, Omashola, Seyi, Frodd, Kim Oprah, Jackye, were all physically present. The show lasted for 30 minutes, with the housemates sharing their audition stories, who they thought had no business in the house, and who were the top highlights? Auditon stories, Kim Oprah said she almost fainted, Mercy said she had auditioned five times before she finally got in, and for Tacha, she went viral before she even entered the house because there was a clip of her being taunted by some other girls while on the queue. In true Tacha fashion, all their taunts did not phase her, she was just focused on her audition process. When she finally got into the house, regardless of the hate she experienced, she was excited. Audition storiesss! Kim Oprah says she almost fainted.#BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM ‚Äî BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 2, 2020 Mercy had auditioned FIVE times before she finally got in.#BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM ‚Äî BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 2, 2020 Tacha too first auditioned in Port Harcourt, wasn‚Äôt picked, then travelled to Enugu.#BBNaijaReunion #BNxBBNaijaReunion https://t.co/tjqgCSLORM ‚Äî BellaNaija (@bellanaija) June 2, 2020 Frodd says he tells people they need connection from God to get into the house.
