Ajax director Edwin van der Sar has recently all-but confirmed that Manchester United have expressed an interest in Donny van de Beek. Van de Beek, 23, has been on Ajax’s books since the summer of 2008. After shining at youth level with the Dutch powerhouse, the midfielder was eventually promoted to Ajax’s senior side in 2016. And van de Beek has since gone on to play a key role at the heart of the Amsterdam outfit’s midfield. In total, the attack-minded midfielder has notched 175 appearances across all competitions for Ajax’s first-team. The Dutchman was, of course, a key figure in the 2018/19 Ajax team which dominated the Eredivisie and reached the Champions League semi-finals, ousting Real Madrid and Juventus from the competition along the way. But whilst the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt opted to depart the Johan Cruijff ArenA last summer, van de Beek remained. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1149309466-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DOETINCHEM, NETHERLANDS – MAY 15: Edwin van der Sar, Chief Executive of Ajax looks on prior to the Eredivisie match between De Graafschap and Ajax at Stadion De Vijverberg on May 15, 2019 in Doetinchem, Netherlands.

And this sort of form has seen the nine-time capped international go on to garner interest from some European giants. The two sides most persistently linked with the Ajax standout in recent times have been Manchester United and Real Madrid. And now, as mentioned above, Ajax director and former Red Devils star Edwin van der Sar has confirmed that it is clear that clubs liked Man United and Real are showing an interest in van de Beek: “It’s clear that clubs like Real Madrid and United are showing interest in Donny van de Beek.” As quoted by the Evening Standard. It is also worth noting that van de Sar last month revealed that, in 2019, Ajax reached verbal agreements with a number of players, including van de Beek, to stay another season, before the club would help them to secure a transfer: “Last year, we made verbal agreements with [Andre] Onana, [Nicolas] Tagliafico and Van de Beek to stay another season, and then we look to help each other and find the next step in their careers. Nothing has changed.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
