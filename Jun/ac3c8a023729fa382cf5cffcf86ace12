As per a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes, Manchester United have opened negotiations with Velez Sarsfield over the signature of Thiago Almada.

In fact, the technically gifted teen, who is capable of playing either on the wing or in a more central role, has even been dubbed ‘the next Messi’ by members of the Argentine media.
