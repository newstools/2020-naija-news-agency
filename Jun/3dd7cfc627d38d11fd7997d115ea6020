Carlo Ancelotti has moved to provide a team news update on his squad ahead of the upcoming Merseyside derby. The first full round of Premier League fixtures since COVID-19 forced the season to be postponed gets underway this Friday. One of the most high-profile ties of the weekend sees Everton welcome bitter rivals, Liverpool, to Goodison Park on Sunday. You can check out 101’s betting tips for the clash here. The Toffees have failed to beat Liverpool in any competition since 2010, with the last league outing between the pair seeing Everton put to the sword by five goals to two. Carlo Ancelotti and co. will no doubt be keen to avoid a similar drubbing this time out, especially given a victory for Liverpool could see them crowned PL champions – should Manchester City lose to Arsenal on Wednesday. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176877693-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 19: Yerry Mina of Everton during the Premier League match between Everton FC and West Ham United at Goodison Park on October 19, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

Andre Gomes spent much of the current campaign sidelined with a serious ankle problem, but Ancelotti is confident the midfielder will be ok for Sunday: “Andre Gomes is training with the team so he is not going to have a problem for Sunday.” Fabian Delph and Yerry Mina are slightly less nailed on for appearances on Sunday, with the Italian confirming the duo need to be checked closer to the time: “The physical condition of the team in general is good and we are looking to recover Yerry Mina and Fabian Delph. “Mina has a check on Wednesday, so we will see with him [if he is ready to face Liverpool]. “We have to check on Fabian Delph, also. “They are both close to coming back to training but remain doubts for the game on Sunday. “If they do not play, we hope they will be with us for the match at Norwich, for sure.” Ancelotti finished by confirming that they are hopeful Theo Walcott, who underwent surgery last week, can be back training in three weeks: “Theo Walcott had surgery last week, we hope he will not be long in recovery and can be ready to come back with us [in training] in three weeks.” l The latest team news ahead of Sunday’s @premierleague return, with @aftgomes back in training…#EFC — Everton (@Everton) June 16, 2020 See also: Manchester City vs Arsenal preview: Premier League live streaming and betting tips Aston Villa vs Sheffield United preview: Premier League live streaming & betting tips Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
