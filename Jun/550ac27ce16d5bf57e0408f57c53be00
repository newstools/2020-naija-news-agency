Updates on Manchester United’s respective transfer pursuits of Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham have been forthcoming online this week. Ahead of the opening of the delayed summer transfer window, Premier League giants Man United have been tipped as a potential landing spot for a whole host of star names. On the back of the upturn in form enjoyed by the Red Devils following Bruno Fernandes’ January arrival, things are finally starting to look up at Old Trafford. Before the outbreak of COVID-19 brought football across the UK to a standstill back in March, United were in the midst of a 10-game unbeaten streak across all competitions. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and co., meanwhile, appear to have a firm recruitment plan in place moving forward, which is set to see the Manchester powerhouse focus their attentions on signing and developing young talent, to surround high-profile names like the aforementioned Fernandes, Paul Pogba and David de Gea. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1161053832.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Paul Pogba" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – AUGUST 11: Paul Pogba of Manchester United at full time of the Premier League match between Manchester United and Chelsea FC at Old Trafford on August 11, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Both would fit in with the Red Devils’ focus on young British talent, with Dortmund sensation Sancho’s potential arrival in particular having resulted in widespread excitement amongst the club’s fans. And, as outlined above, updates on United’s pursuits of both starlets have this week been forthcoming. First comes the latest on Bellingham. The Manchester Evening News have suggested that Pep Clotet’s imminent departure from the Birmingham bench makes teenage sensation Bellingham’s exit over the coming months a near-inevitability. Significantly, though, speculation elsewhere has assured that, should the gifted midfielder, as expected, choose to move on, his representatives would rather Bellingham join Borussia Dortmund, rather than Manchester United. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1165154349-1024x759.jpg?resize=1024%2C759&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Birmingham City’s Jude Bellingham celebrates at the end of the game.

A report from the Telegraph this evening has provided an insight into the exorbitant fee that Dortmund are expected to demand for their explosive wide-man this summer. According to Mike McGrath, the Bundesliga giants are seeking out a sum of no less than £115 million for Sancho. This has, understandably, thrown any potential summer transfer for the English international into major doubt. McGrath suggests that Manchester United were in fact leading the chase for Sancho before the COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year, but the Red Devils are now ‘wary of committing to a Premier League record-breaking deal’ during a period of such financial uncertainty.
