Robbie Fowler has recently claimed that Timo Werner, who Liverpool are now seemingly set to miss out on to Premier League rivals, Chelsea, isn’t on the same level as the Reds’ current attacking trident. Timo Werner is one of the most in-form strikers in the Bundesliga right now. Throughout the course of the 2019/20 campaign, the German has notched 41 appearances across all competitions. In said ties, Werner has netted 31 and assisted 13. This, understandably, looks to have attracted interest from some of Europe’s heavy hitters. The side most persistently linked with Werner throughout the current campaign has been Premier League high-flyers, Liverpool. Despite this, Jurgen Klopp and co. look set to miss out on the hitman, with Chelsea now said to be the side closing in on a deal for Werner. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1195518790-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WOLVERHAMPTON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 23: Sadio Mane of Liverpool sits injured on the floor during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Liverpool FC at Molineux on January 23, 2020 in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.

Writing in his column for the Mirror, Fowler stated that, in his opinion, Werner isn’t up to the standard of Liverpool’s front three: “I’ve heard the noise ­surrounding Timo Werner in recent weeks – but I’m not a big fan. “I realise he’s a talented player, he has moments of real brilliance in matches that underline his quality. But I stand by this: is Werner up to the standard of Liverpool’s current front three? Not for me.” Fowler continued: “I’ve also seen the meltdown from some Liverpool fans when they ­realised he’s probably not leaving RB Leipzig for Anfield after all. It makes it seem as though he’s a Marco van Basten, a world-class player who would walk into any side. “For the life of me, I don’t know why .. does he influence games consistently enough? Not for me. Does he match up to the players you are signing him to challenge and replace? Not at Liverpool. Maybe at Chelsea.” Quotes via the Evening Standard. For the record, Werner’s total of 44 goal contributions in 41 games this term is more than all of Liverpool’s main front three. Roberto Firmino has managed 23 contributions in 43 ties, Mohamed Salah 29 from 40 and Sadio Mane 30 from 38.
