The singer posted the official legal document on Instagram on Tuesday, the 16th of June 2020, stating in the caption that accompanied the legal document that although he did not want to respond to the accusations, his silence is empowering the accuser to think he is scared; Read his statement below; ‚ÄúToday is exactly 1 week after my birthday and this will be the only time I will address the recent false allegations and lies from the pit of hell. I have chosen to do so because the incident is a slap to my marriage and my beautiful wife, my entire family and those who believe in me. I did not want to dignify the slurs with a response but it appears my silence has empowered my accusers to think I have been scared into the shadows so I would like to state that This Accusation are false and ludicrous and Have been handed over to my Legal Team, while the Nigerian Police is Investigating the Criminal aspect of it. It‚Äôs unfortunate that this is coming a few weeks before the second anniversary of my late son Daniel And this well-timed falsehood has reopened the painful scars of my deep loss. To my fans and loved ones, thanks for the support, your prayers and your positive comments. The truth will always prevail.
