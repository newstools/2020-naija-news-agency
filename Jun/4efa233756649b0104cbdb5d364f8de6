A fresh potential landing spot for Chelsea’s Willian has emerged in the last 24 hours. Willian, now 31, has been on Chelsea’s books since the summer of 2013. During this period, the Brazilian has cemented himself as a mainstay in the Blues’ attack, notching over 300 appearances and winning a plethora of trophies. Even during the current campaign, Willian has been integral to Frank Lampard’s setup, garnering 37 appearances across all competitions. However, the Brazilian’s stint at Stamford Bridge appears to be nearing its conclusion. Willian’s current deal is set to expire on the 30th of June. And whilst negotiations over fresh terms appear to have been going on throughout the season, no conclusion has yet been reached. The biggest sticking point for Willian looks to be him wanting a three-year deal, with Chelsea said to be only offering two. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1161224068.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DUBLIN, IRELAND – JULY 10: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea arrives at the stadium prior to the Pre-Season Friendly match between Bohemians FC and Chelsea FC at Dalymount Park on July 10, 2019 in Dublin, Ireland.

Such uncertainty has, understandably, led to rumours of where the pacey winger could end up next. All of Tottenham, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Barcelona have previously been touted as potential destinations for the Chelsea man. However, as mentioned above, another of Europe’s heavy-hitters appear to have thrown their hat into the ring. As per Goal, citing France Football, Manchester United are interested in signing Willian on a free transfer this summer when his current contract expires. The Red Devils are also understood to have made contact with Willian’s representatives.
