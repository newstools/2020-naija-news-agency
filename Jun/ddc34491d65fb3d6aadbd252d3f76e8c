Speculation stemming from the Spanish media today suggests that a midfield swap deal could be on the cards between Arsenal and Atletico Madrid. Ahead of the opening of the summer transfer window, Premier League giants Arsenal have been tipped to swoop for a whole host of stars across Europe. Dayot Upamecano, Dominik Szoboszlai and Willian are just 3 of the players named as potential arrivals in north London ahead of next season, with Mikel Arteta no doubt eager to put his own stamp on the Gunners’ squad during his first full summer at the helm. To this point, however, none have been linked with an Emirates switch on a more persistent basis than Thomas Partey. Atletico Madrid star Partey has developed into one of La Liga’s standout midfielders over the last couple of seasons, with Mikel Arteta known to be a keen admirer. This has seen rumours rampant that the Ghanaian has been identified as Arsenal’s undisputed no. 1 summer transfer target. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1133463388-1024x711.jpg?resize=1024%2C711&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SAN SEBASTIAN, SPAIN – MARCH 03: Thomas Teye Partey of Atletico Madrid looks on prior to the start the La Liga match between Real Sociedad and Club Atletico de Madrid at Estadio Anoeta on March 03, 2019 in San Sebastian, Spain.

The 27-year-old’s Atletico contract is known to possess a €50 million release clause. And though such a sum actually represents a very reasonable price-tag for a player of Partey’s quality, Arsenal would likely still struggle to afford it outright. If the aforementioned speculation stemming from Spain today is to be believed, though, then the north Londoners could have an ace up their sleeve, in the form of Matteo Guendouzi. Midfield starlet Guendouzi has endured a difficult week in the English capital, having been heavily criticised for his role in a post-match incident versus Brighton, before being dropped for his side’s ensuing meetings with Southampton and Sheffield United.

And, according to El Gol Digital, this could bring about a swap deal between the Gunners and Atletico, which would satisfy all parties involved. The deal in question would see Guendouzi make the move to the Wanda Metropolitano, in exchange for Partey. Diego Simeone, who has long accepted the fact that his midfield will be stripped of one of its star men this summer, is said to be a huge fan of Guendouzi’s talents, and would be happy to add the 21-year-old to his side’s ranks. It is even suggested that the exchange would involve no fee, with both players valued at around €50 million. Arsenal forking over a cash sum on top of Guendouzi, though, appears a more realistic avenue.
