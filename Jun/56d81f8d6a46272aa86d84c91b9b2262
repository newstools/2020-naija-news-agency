The latest word stemming from the English media today suggests that Chelsea are readying a contract offer for Angel Gomes, as the youngster prepares to depart Manchester United. Gomes, a 19-year-old attacking midfielder, is a product of United’s academy. The English U20-international has spent his entire career to date on the books of the Manchester giants, having originally committed to the club in 2006. From an early age, it was evident to all at Old Trafford that Gomes was a special talent, with the starlet’s flair and eye for the spectacular having seen him quickly fast-tracked into the first-team picture of the Red Devils. This eventually saw Gomes go on to make his Premier League debut at the age of just 16, when the London native was introduced off the bench versus Crystal Palace on the final day of the 2016/17 campaign. This made Gomes the youngest player to feature for United since Duncan Edwards over 60 years prior. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686349002-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" alt="Angel Gomes" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – MAY 21: Angel Gomes of Manchester United comes on for Wayne Rooney of Manchester United during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on May 21, 2017 in Manchester, England.

The years since, however, have seen Gomes struggle to kick on as part of the first-team ranks at Old Trafford. While fellow starlets Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood, both younger than Gomes, have carved out regular opportunities for themselves amid Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s youth drive, the diminutive midfielder has continued to toil in his search of senior minutes. Such struggles, meanwhile, have led to widespread speculation surrounding Gomes’ future of late. The 19-year-old’s current contract with Manchester United is due to expire on June 30th. Recent reports had seen the claim pushed, though, that Gomes had been convinced of his place in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s plans moving forward, and was, as a result, ready to commit to the terms of a new deal at Old Trafford. As such, it came as something of a surprise when, after being drawn on the situation earlier today, Solskjaer confirmed that all signs are now pointing towards Gomes moving on: OGS confirms no agreement reached with Angel Gomes and ‘it looks like’ he will be leaving @ManUtd — Simon Stone (@sistoney67) June 29, 2020 And, if speculation on the back of the United boss’ bombshell proves accurate, then Gomes’ future may in fact not lie too far away from Manchester. As per Miguel Delaney, one of the Red Devils’ Premier League rivals are ready to offer a contract to the midfield starlet. The outfit in question? Chelsea. The Blues have long been named as admirers of Gomes’ talents, and are now seemingly ready to pounce for his signature. Delaney suggests that a ‘lucrative’ proposal is being prepared on the part of Frank Lampard’s men, presumably worth considerably more than the £25,000-per-week that the teen was offered by Manchester United. Chelsea, though, are far from the only club interested, with the likes of Valencia, Benfica and Hamburg all also said to be in the hunt.
