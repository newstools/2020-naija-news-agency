Southampton manager Ralph Hasenuttl has recently been discussing the future of one of his former players, Chelsea-linked attacker Timo Werner. For the majority of the 2019/20 campaign, Timo Werner has been linked with a move to the English top-flight. The German hitman, who has provided 44 goal contributions in 41 outings this term, was persistently linked to Liverpool – with Werner himself having appeared to court Jurgen Klopp and the Reds. Yet despite all signs pointing to Werner linking up with the soon-to-be Premier League champions, reports earlier this month revealed that the Leipzig standout is now set for a move to one of Liverpool’s rivals. The outfit in question are Chelsea, with the Telegraph having reported on June 5th that Werner has agreed to join the Blues, with the club on the brink of tying up a deal to land the forward. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185190978-1024x740.jpg?resize=1024%2C740&#038;ssl=1" alt="Timo Werner" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEIPZIG, GERMANY – NOVEMBER 02: Timo Werner of RB Leipzig celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal during the Bundesliga match between RB Leipzig and 1.

And the Blues faithful will likely be even more excited at this prospect after reading what one of Werner’s former managers has recently had to say about the German. Ralph Hasenhuttl will probably be known by most Chelsea fans due to the fact that he is currently Southampton boss. Prior to his stint at St Mary’s, though, Hasenhuttl was in charge of RB Leipzig, meaning the Austrian has first-hand experience of Werner’s talents. And speaking in a recent interview with Sport Bild, Hasenhuttl voiced his opinion that the intense, fast-paced nature of the English game would suit Werner: “Football is very intense and fast [in England]. That, in turn, suits Timo: with his speed he’s a brutal weapon in the right team. “He sometimes needs a shoulder to lean on, or a little more encouragement but what I’ve always liked about him is that he scores goals that nobody else scores. “Give him a bit of space and it’s hard to stop him. He has so many qualities that will always put him above others.” Quotes via Goal.
