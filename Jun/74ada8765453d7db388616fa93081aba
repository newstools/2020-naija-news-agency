As Nigeria continues to protest against injustice, violence against women and police brutality, many celebrities are using their platforms to decry the killing of Tina, Uwa, rape of Jennifer, and other unknown victims. While people in Benin have rallied together calling on the government and security agency, demanding justice for the death of Uwa, many Nigerians have also joined the protest via social media. Guys, this is not the time to stay silent! Your voice matters, and it can still be heard even from the comfort of your home. You can join the online protest. It‚Äôs the least we can do from home. Check out how people are ensuring Jennifer, Uwa and Tina get the justice they deserve.  View this post on Instagram  I saw a thread on Twitter, different ladies writing about their traumatic rape experiences. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how these women feel. The pain they suffered and are suffering mentally everyday. It is so heartbreaking. I believe every rapist deserves to die. If you are a rapist out there and you see this, you should be ashamed of yourself and I want you to know that one day you will pay for your barbaric crimes. This goes to rape apologists too and those that know a rapist and is protecting them. SHAME ON YOU. #saynotorape #JusticeforUwa #JusticeforTina #WeAreTired A post shared by  DON JAZZY (@donjazzy) on Jun 1, 2020 at 3:56am PDT  View this post on Instagram  Are we supposed to wake up everyday with the fear. . .  #WeAreTired  #JusticeForUwa  #JusticeForTina  #justiceforAll #SayNoToRape #RapistsAreCriminal A post shared by  Pamilerin Adegoke (@thepamilerin) on Jun 1, 2020 at 4:15am PDT  View this post on Instagram  My heart bleeds.  Uwa and Tina‚Äôs lives have been cut short because we‚Äôve raised and enabled a generation of men who believe women should be exploited not protected.  We‚Äôve enabled powerdrunk senseless men with uniforms and weapons.  We are not allowed to sit down there and say ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù fuck that! All men are responsible. Your brother‚Äôs heart is desperately wicked and you have enabled it, wether in catcalling or in objectification. We have enabled it. Not waiting on the government to do anything, don‚Äôt want to set myself up for further disappointment.  I pray we raise better sons and enable better men.

What even upsets me more is when I hear people make comments trying to justify this horrific act with comments like ‚Äúbut what were you wearing?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat were you doing there?‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt scream, you stayed there‚Äù ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt push them‚Äù ‚Äúdid you have anything to drink?‚Äù. If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôve at some point made such comments to a victim of sexual abuse, please don‚Äôt ever do it again. Our society today needs to learn to blame the rapists and not victims. #nomeansno #consentiskey #rapeawareness #womenempowerment #consentculture #wearetired #women #men # rapeisrape #sexualassaultawareness #justicefortina #justiceforuwa #nothingjustifiesrape #girlwiththesign #mybodymychoice #saynotorape #stoprapingus A post shared by  Peace Idahosa (@peaceidahosa) on Jun 1, 2020 at 9:18am PDT  View this post on Instagram  We have had enough of this sick rape culture. NO MEANS NO. Don‚Äôt try to coerce me into saying YES! Dead that sense of entitlement to a woman‚Äôs body. The only reason for RAPE IS RAPISTS. We are tired of it.
