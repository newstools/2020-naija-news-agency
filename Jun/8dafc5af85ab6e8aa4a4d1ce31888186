Neal Maupay has this evening quite literally added insult to injury, on the back of his last-gasp Brighton winner versus Arsenal. Mikel Arteta’s men visited the Amex Stadium a short time ago, for their 2nd outing following the COVID-19-enforced break. The Gunners headed into proceedings aware that nothing but 3 points would suffice, having seen their fading hopes of securing European football for next season dealt another blow versus Manchester City on Wednesday night. When all was said and done in East Sussex, though, Arsenal’s woes only worsened. A staggering affair saw the north Londoners somehow manage to surrender a late lead, to eventually succumb to a 2-1 defeat. Nicolas Pepe opened the scoring for the visitors with 68 minutes on the clock, with a sumptuous curling strike from the right. Arsenal’s lead lasted just 7 minutes, though, before a scramble in the away side’s box saw Lewis Dunk net on the rebound from close range. Then, with essentially the last kick of the game, Brighton bagged an all-important winner. A superb piece of football from Graham Potter’s men saw substitute Aaron Connolly slip Neal Maupay through, with the Frenchman having gone on to slot home into the roof of the net in style. Maupay’s last-gasp strike, though, while obviously leading to wild celebrations on the part of the hosts, also resulted in tensions boiling over following the full-time whistle. This came with a number of Arsenal’s stars still angry with Brighton’s match-winner following a coming together with Bernd Leno during the first-half. As the Arsenal goalkeeper came out to collect what looked set to be a simple catch on the edge of his box, Maupay jumped into Leno rather unnecessarily. This knocked the 28-year-old off balance, and resulted in Leno landing awkwardly on his right foot. The German’s knee then shifted in nasty fashion, leaving Leno in agony on the Amex turf. Arsenal’s medics quickly arrived on the scene, lifting the club’s no.1 onto a stretcher, before taking him straight down the tunnel ahead of what looks set to be a lengthy spell on the sidelines. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1221136700-1024x668.jpg?resize=1024%2C668&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s German goalkeeper Bernd Leno (on stretcher) remonstrates with Brighton’s French striker Neal Maupay after the keeper was injured during the English Premier League football match between Brighton and Hove Albion and Arsenal at the American Express Community Stadium in Brighton, southern England on June 20, 2020.

Speaking in a post-match interview this evening, the Seagulls star was drawn on his challenge on Leno, with Maupay having assured that he never intended to injure the German shot-stopper: ‘At half-time I went to the manager Mikel Arteta to apologise. I never meant to injure the keeper. I jumped for the ball.’ ‘I apologise to the team and to him (Leno) as well. I have been through a bad injury, it is hard.’ The Brighton attacker, though, was not done there. He then went on to suggest that Arsenal’s players could do with learning to be more humble, before insinuating that their behaviour throughout the clash meant that a defeat was exactly what the Gunners deserved: ‘Arsenal players maybe need to learn humility sometimes. They were talking a lot. They got what they deserved.’ “I never meant to hurt Leno.” “Some of the Arsenal players need to learn humility.” “They got what they deserved.” Brighton’s match-winner Neal Maupay catches up with @lynseyhipgrave1 following their 2-1 win over Arsenal at the Amex… #PLReturns pic.twitter.com/6cqakMiqcE — The Premier League is BACK on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) June 20, 2020 Arsenal the latest club tipped to swoop for Thiago Almada/Arteta confirms plans to make Mari signing permanent David Luiz’s agent coy on defender’s Arsenal future: ‘We will find out before 23rd June’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
