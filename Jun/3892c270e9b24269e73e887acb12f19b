Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has confirmed that star winger Ryan Fraser will not line out for the club again, ahead of the imminent expiry of his contract. 26-year-old winger Fraser has been plying his trade at the Vitality Stadium since 2013, when he arrived from Aberdeen. And, after playing a key role in the club’s promotion to the Premier League in 2016, the Scot has since gone from strength to strength. It was his stellar production last season, though, which saw many begin to stand up and take notice of Fraser’s talents. Across appearances in all 38 of Bournemouth’s league fixtures (35 starts), the pacy wide-man directly contributed to 21 goals. His haul of 14 assists, meanwhile, proved the 2nd-highest total in the English top-flight, behind only Eden Hazard. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1054185084-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 27: Callum Wilson of AFC Bournemouth celebrates with teammate Ryan Fraser after scoring a penalty for his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Fulham FC and AFC Bournemouth at Craven Cottage on October 27, 2018 in London, United Kingdom.

Last summer saw Arsenal persistently touted as a potential destination for Fraser, with the Cherries star having also been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool in January.

Recent weeks, though, have seen a new frontrunner in the race for the 26-year-old, in the form of Tottenham, pushed by the media. The north Londoners are even thought to have put together a contract offer for the wantaway Bournemouth man. And, as outlined above, Fraser has evidently had his head turned by the rumoured interest in his signature. Confirmation has arrived this week that the Scot will not line out for his current employers again, having come to the definitive decision to move on. Fraser could have put pen-to-paper on a short-term extension at the Vitality to see out the final weeks of the extended campaign on the books of the Cherries. However, following his refusal to do so, Eddie Howe has announced that Fraser’s appearance versus Liverpool back in March will mark his final one in Bournemouth’s colours: ‘[Fraser] has now played his last game for the football club. He won’t be involved with us for the last nine games.’ ‘I only want players who are fully focused on the relegation battle we have ahead and I’m looking forward to doing that with my squad.’ ‘These are the most important games this football club has had in recent times and we need everybody in the same position mentally, fight tooth and nail for the football club.’ ‘Ryan, due to his contract situation, can’t commit to that. Two games for us wasn’t going to make the difference. We need a nine-game commitment and he can’t give that at this moment in time.’ Quotes via Sky Sports Top Premier League clubs expected to sit out next season’s League Cup Frank Lampard opens up on Chelsea’s Timo Werner signing/Provides updates on Hudson-Odoi & Loftus-Cheek before Villa Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
