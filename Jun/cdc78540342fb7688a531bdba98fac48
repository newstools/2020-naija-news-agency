Speculation stemming from the Spanish media suggests that Valencia are eyeing an audacious loan swoop for Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. The situation between the posts has proven a major source of concern at Chelsea to this point in the campaign. Up until February, Spanish shot-stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga had stood as the Blues’ undisputed first-choice. Having begun to justify his hefty price-tag with a string of superb displays towards the end of the 2018/19 campaign, Kepa was subsequently expected to kick on and stake his claim as one of world football’s finest goalkeepers. However, this has since proven far from the case. The 25-year-old, much like fellow countryman David de Gea at Manchester United, has often looked a weak link for his side this season. In fact, so frequent were Kepa’s mistake-riddled displays over the months leading up to the turn of the year, that they even resulted in him losing his place in Chelsea’s starting XI to veteran Willy Caballero for several weeks. Highlighting the woes of the former Athletic Bilbao man, meanwhile, was the statistic that, as of January, he was the owner of the worst save percentage of any Premier League goalkeeper in 2019/20. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1190079916-1024x750.jpg?resize=1024%2C750&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 22: Antonio Rudiger of Chelsea tries to shield the ball so that Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga can gather the ball during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on December 22, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Reports in the English media previously hinted that the 25-year-old was ready to push for a Blues exit, while Spanish outlets have hinted at his potential inclusion in a swap deal involving Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak. And, as outlined above, another potential landing spot for the out-of-form Chelsea shot-stopper has been touted over the last 48 hours. As per a report from Marca, Valencia are eyeing up a summer swoop for Kepa. Current Los Che no.1 Jasper Cillessen is expected to move on over the coming months, with Kepa seemingly viewed as an ideal replacement. With Valencia’s transfer chiefs no doubt aware that the Blues star would not be available on the cheap, though, they have formulated a plan, to spread out the cost. It is suggested that Kepa could make the move to the Mestalla on a 2-year loan, a deal which would include either an option or obligation to buy. Somewhat outlandishly, the possibility of a 3-team goalkeeper swap is also touted, between Chelsea, Valencia and Dutch champions Ajax. Such an agreement would see Kepa return to Spain, Andre Onana make the move to Stamford Bridge, and Cillessen replace Onana in Amsterdam. In other Chelsea-related news, meanwhile, Marco van Ginkel has put pen-to-paper on a new deal with the Pensioners. 27-year-old midfielder van Ginkel has been on the books of the Premier League giants since 2013, but a combination of loan spells away from the club and injury issues have seen him go on to make just 2 Premier League appearances. Despite his long-standing Chelsea struggles, though, the Dutchman has today been handed what is no doubt set to prove his final chance to prove himself in the English capital. In an announcement this morning, news was forthcoming that van Ginkel has signed a one-year extension with the Blues, to take him through to the summer of 2021: Congratulations, Marco! — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) June 26, 2020 Chelsea the latest Premier League club tipped to swoop for RB Leipzig’s Dayot UpamecanoTimo Werner’s massive Chelsea wages revealed with attacker also expected to bag €11m signing bonusOriginal Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
