A host of top clubs across Europe have this evening been put on alert, after PSG director Leonardo confirmed that the club are set to part ways with both Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva this summer. Uruguayan hitman Cavani and Brazilian stopper Silva have long stood as pillars of PSG’s success. After the latter made the move to the Parc des Princes in the summer of 2012, Cavani followed suit 12 months later, as the Parisians’ attempts to establish themselves as genuine contenders for the Champions League became evident. And, though this long-standing quest for European glory never quite came to fruition for PSG, the key role played by both of the aforementioned big-money arrivals over the last 7 years cannot be understated. The pair have combined to rack up over 600 appearances across all competitions in the colours of the Ligue 1 giants, with Cavani having notched a staggering 200 goals in the process. Such exploits have resulted in PSG utterly dominating the landscape of French football over the course of the last decade, with Silva, for his part, having secured 21 domestic trophies whilst in Paris. This includes league titles in all but one of his eight seasons in France. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-886459590-1024x727.jpg?resize=1024%2C727&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MUNICH, GERMANY – DECEMBER 05: Thiago Silva of PSG argues with James Rodriguez of Bayern Muenchen and Corentin Tolisso of Bayern Muenchen during the UEFA Champions League group B match between Bayern Muenchen and Paris Saint-Germain at Allianz Arena on December 5, 2017 in Munich, Germany.

This comes after Leonardo, sporting director at the Parc des Princes, this evening confirmed that both Cavani and Silva are set to depart the club this summer. The contracts of the South American veterans are due to expire this month, meaning both will be available as free agents. Leonardo: “Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva will leave PSG at the end of the season, it’s confirmed”.  #PSG #transfers — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 13, 2020 Cavani has previously been linked with a switch to Atletico Madrid whilst Silva has reportedly caught the eye of a number of Premier League sides, including Arsenal.
