Real name, Ewomazino Ernest Frank, the twenty-four year old undergraduate is set to make his mark on the Nigerian music industry scene and beyond as he currently is the front-man for Mum Entertainment with quite a number of singles in his portfolio. Zinoboy is set to release a new single along with a viral visual directed by Kwart Films titled “African Woman,” a song which praises and adores African ladies in all of their glory; with a head-bopping instrumentation crafted by Magic City Music Group’s very own artiste/producer, Frankie Free, this new single marks his debut on to the Nigerian music scene and also, a taste of what’s to come.
