Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder faced the press via Zoom on Monday ahead of the restart of the Premier League. One big question mark hanging over the Blades has been the ongoing future of Dean Henderson. Henderson has enjoyed a remarkable season in goal at Bramall Lane. However, the keeper’s loan contract from Man United expires on June 30. Some had suggested that Man United would order Henderson to return to Old Trafford for July 1 in order to hurt Sheffield United’s chance in securing European football next season. However, Chris Wilder has today confirmed that Henderson will remain in Sheffield until the end of the campaign. He said: I spoke to Ole (Gunner Solskjaer) yesterday morning and I thanked him for his co-operation with Dean. We’re in a situation where Dean will hopefully agree a deal to stay until the end of the season in the coming days. “I spoke to Ole yesterday morning and I thanked him for his co-operation with Dean.

However, the manager has revealed he was in contract talks with the Blades over a new deal before the Covid-19 pandemic began. Those talks are now on hold. ‘We were in conversations before & they were paused because I didn’t think it was morally right at that stage of the pandemic. They are in the negotiation stages. I’ve said it before that I have responsibility to the club to get the best deal for #SUFC.’ The Gaffer on new ’s pic.twitter.com/9H1YtmC58T — Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) June 15, 2020 Also see: Manchester United set to drop Paul Pogba against Tottenham.
