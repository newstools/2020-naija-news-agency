Manchester United have reportedly come to the decision to allow Dean Henderson to see out the remainder of the extended campaign with Sheffield United. Highly-regarded shot-stopper Henderson has spent the last 2 years plying his trade at Bramall Lane. And, after playing a key role in the Blades’ return to the Premier League in 2018/19, the 23-year-old’s stock has continued to rise to this point in the current campaign. As Chris Wilder’s men continue to defy the odds in battling it out for a European berth, Henderson has conceded just 22 goals across 27 appearances. This is a defensive record bettered only by top of the table Liverpool. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142181601.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Stoke City goalkeeper Dean Henderson Stoke City v Sheffield United – Sky Bet Championship – bet365 Stadium 05-05-2019 .

As things stand, the terms of the former English youth international’s deal with Sheffield United are due to expire on the 30th of June. This of course poses a major problem for the Blades, with the extended Premier League season expected to drag into July, or even August, and Manchester United well within their rights to refuse an extension to Henderson’s loan. The tense battle for European places in the English top-flight, meanwhile, had even resulted in murmurs of late that the Red Devils were taking into serious consideration keeping hold of their on-loan shot-stopper for the final weeks of the campaign, to put Sheffield United at a disadvantage. If Chris Wilder’s men put Aston Villa to the sword in their return to action next Wednesday night, they will actually leapfrog Man United into 5th in the Premier League table. As outlined above, however, if the latest word stemming from the media is to be believed, then fans of the Blades need not worry. As confirmed by David Hytner of the Guardian, an agreement in principle has been reached, which will see Henderson’s loan extended to cover the season’s remaining fixtures. ‘Only the final details’ are now left to be ironed out, with an official announcement expected to be forthcoming imminently. Manchester United agree for Dean Henderson to stay at Sheffield United.
