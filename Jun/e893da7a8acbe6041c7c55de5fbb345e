Ballon d’Or winner Luka Modric has begun a promotional tour on Monday ahead of the release of his new autobiography. Today, Modric has spoken to leading Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport. Tutto lo scontento di Conte. La #primapagina di oggi pic.twitter.com/SR1RljNESa — LaGazzettadelloSport (@Gazzetta_it) June 15, 2020 One of the key quotes from the Modric interview is related to French forward Kylian Mbappe. It’s been another superb season for Mbappe at PSG, as the 21-year-old scored 18 goals in 20 Ligue 1 matches. In the Champions League, Mbappe has 5 goals and 5 assists in 7 games. RIDICULOUS PACE Kylian Mbappe’s best-ever goal? pic.twitter.com/n3IoI6nuVY — Alexander Umeakubuike™  (@AUmeakubuike) June 11, 2020 Mbappe is under contract in Paris until 2022, however Modric has openly encouraged the striker to leave the French capital. When asked to name his stars of tomorrow, the 34-year-old Croat said: Mbappe has it all, but I think that to make the leap in quality he needs to go to a league where his team does not win so easily. Modric’s comments on Mbappe, however, became a little confusing considering the midfielder’s answer to a question on who are the favourites to win this year’s Champions League. Modric said: In the Champions League, I see PSG doing well, even if they don’t play until August. It’s easy to say Barcelona and Bayern. You have to be careful with Atletico de Madrid and, of course, whoever progresses from Manchester City vs Real Madrid will be among the favourites. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-1039446474-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Luka Modric wins The Best" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 24: Luka Modric of Real Madrid receives the trophy for The Best FIFA Men’s Player 2018 during the The Best FIFA Football Awards Show at Royal Festival Hall on September 24, 2018 in London, England. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images) Completing his answer on the future stars of tomorrow, Modric also named two Man City stars: I also see great potential in Vinicius (Junior) and I like (Kevin) De Bruyne and (Raheem) Sterling. Obviously, it’s difficult to call KDB a youngster: he’s 28. Sterling is 25. Modric saw De Bruyne and Sterling in action just before football stopped back in March. Man City won 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu in the Champions League last-16, with the Belgian scoring the decisive goal of the game. Modric is under contract with Real Madrid until 2021. Gazzetta asked the Croat if he’s considering retirement, and he replied: I am sure I can play at a high level for two more years, then we will see. I would like to finish my career at Real Madrid, but it will also depend on the club. Modric also confirmed that he plans to go into coaching once he finally finishes his playing career.
