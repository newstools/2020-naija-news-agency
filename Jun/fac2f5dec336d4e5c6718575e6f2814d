Lyon coach Rudi Garcia has recently claimed that the French side is yet to receive any offers for a pair of their top stars. Lyon did not have the most prolific 2019/20 campaign. Before COVID-19 brought football around Europe to a near standstill, Les Gones were sat 7th in Ligue 1 – meaning they are now set to miss out on European football next term due to the French top-flight finishing early. However, whilst 2019/20 will likely be a season to forget at the Stade de Lyon, there have been a few bright sparks for Lyon this term. Two of which come in the form of some exceptionally talented youngsters. The pair in question are Moussa Dembele and Houssem Aouar. The former had a sensational season in front of goal, netting 22 and assisting seven for Lyon – whilst Aouar, now 21, has once again showcased his wide-ranging ability in the middle of the park for the Ligue 1 outfit. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1203583650-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> OL STADIUM, LYON, FRANCE – 2020/02/26: Houssem Aouar of Olympique Lyonnais during the Uefa Champions League match between Olympique Lyonnais and Juventus Fc.

The duo seems to have earned particular interest from the Manchester-based clubs. It was claimed back in April that Manchester City were set to make formal contact with Lyon over Aouar. As for Dembele, Manchester United was touted as a potential landing spot for the hitman last month. However, if the aforementioned comments from Rudi Garcia are to be believed, then neither of City or United are that advanced in their potential negotiations for Dembele and Aouar. Speaking in an interview with RTL, the Lyon coach claimed that they are yet to receive any offers for the duo in question: “I hope that Houssem Aouar will stay. Him and Moussa Dembele. I can tell you categorically that we have not received any offers for them. “I am told that Memphis is also not on the list of possible departures.” Quotes via Goal.
