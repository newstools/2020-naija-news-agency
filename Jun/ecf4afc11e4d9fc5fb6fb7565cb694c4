Last week Arsenal announced four new contract extensions. Since joining Arsenal on loan from Southampton, Cedric Soares has yet to feature for the Gunners. However, Cedric, soon to be 29, has been handed a 4-year deal to stay at Arsenal. David Luiz has agreed a one-year deal to remain at Arsenal. Arsenal have also signed Pablo Mari to a 4-year deal, while the Gunners agreed to keep Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid until the end of the Premier League season. On Sunday, the Telegraph have provided some more details on David Luiz’s contract. Understand David Luiz is on significantly reduced terms with his new #AFC contract. Brazilian’s reduction in pay is a big reason that Arsenal, for all their financial struggles, were able to offer permanent deals to Cedric and Mari. More details @TeleFootball later. — Sam Dean (@SamJDean) June 27, 2020 The way the news is presented, Arsenal were only able to agree the three other deals because Luiz agreed to lower his salary: It is understood that the offers of new contracts to all three players were made possible by Luiz, who previously earned around £120,000 a week, agreeing to a reduction in his pay. Cedric is seen as someone who brings experience to the defence. The full-back will be 32 at the end of his new four-year contract but there is an acceptance that players who arrive on a free deal command greater financial commitments because of the lack of transfer fee.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain left Arsenal for Liverpool in 2017. According to the Mail on Sunday: Arsenal are also due a windfall as part of the deal that saw Oxlade-Chamberlain join Liverpool. Unfortunately the report fails to state just how much Liverpool will pay the Gunners. Yet, readers are told that Liverpool’s total payments are only 10 million pounds, while Southampton are the big winners: Southampton will profit the most. They are due a significant seven-figure sum, as high as £3m, for the transfers that saw Van Dijk, Sadio Mane, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren move to Anfield. Other clubs in line for payments included Hull (Andy Robertson) and Charlton (Joe Gomez).
