It was gathered that Spicy is a “Stud” and killed Vivian out of the fear that she might expose her for sleeping with a man, thereby ruining her reputation. She was also reported to have carted away the deceased’s properties to Enugu State where she was eventually arrested. After committing the crime, Spicy was said to have gone ahead to call Vivian’s mother to inform her that her daughter had traveled. It was not until Monday, June 15, 2020, that residents discovered the decomposing body of the deceased after breaking into her room due to the foul odour they were perceiving in the compound.
