Updates on the fitness of Chelsea stars Callum Hudson-Odoi, N’Golo Kante and Reece James have been forthcoming online this evening. The Premier League campaign is of course set to get back underway this week. Following a 3-month hiatus amid the COVID-19 crisis, a pair of fixtures on Wednesday night will see the English top-flight return to screens across the globe. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1219355269-1024x654.jpg?resize=1024%2C654&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WHICHFORD, ENGLAND – APRIL 17: Nike Premier League Strike Football photographed on April 23, 2020 in Whichford, Warwickshire, United Kingdom.

(Photo by VISIONHAUS) The battle for Europe will then recommence on Friday night, as part of the first full gameweek since March. The side occupying the final Champions League berth, as things stand, are Chelsea. However, with Manchester United just 3 points behind the Blues, a victory for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men over Tottenham on Friday night would see Chelsea, at least temporarily, ousted from the top-4. As such, the Londoners will no doubt be keen for a positive restart of their own. Frank Lampard’s outfit are set to visit Villa Park, for a Sunday evening meeting with the relegation-battling Claret and Blue. And, as outlined above, ahead of Chelsea’s trip to Aston Villa, updates on the fitness of a trio of the Blues’ key men have today been forthcoming. In a boost for the capital giants, the news is altogether positive, with the reliable Nizaar Kinsella of Goal.com having confirmed that Lampard has ‘a full squad of options ahead of the Premier League’s restart.’ Callum Hudson-Odoi has shaken off a knock that saw the English wide-man miss out on Chelsea’s friendly drubbing of QPR over the weekend, with fellow starlet Reece James also back in contention to start after a recent fitness concern. Finally, N’Golo Kante, who previously opted to keep his distance from the Blues’ training ground due to fears over potentially contracting COVID-19, has returned to full contact training, and is also ready to feature from the off versus Aston Villa.
