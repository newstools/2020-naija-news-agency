The term intends to give a platform for artistes to break from the norm. It gives space for an artiste’s tendency to be innovative and reinvent genres. It has led to a small group of Nigerian artistes to define themselves as part of a movement called ‘Alté. Alte guys? Who are the Alte guys? According to the Urban Dictionary, they are ‘a bunch of Lagos kids who wear ugly glasses and oversized jeans with ugly shirts all in the name of being different, they also wear dirty sneakers which why they look like miscreants. They listen to weird music in the name of being edgy but in reality, they are stupid. You might spot them at a party flocking together like cattle if they want to be mad they show up to motive shirtless’. Obviously, this is one person’s opinion so they shouldn’t be judged based on that. A lot of listeners don’t seem to understand them in terms of their eccentricity and vibe, what they offer is not regular so it makes them easy preys for criticism. Alternative music is not for everyone, so it is fine if you can’t relate to it.
