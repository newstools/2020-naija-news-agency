Some states had recently discharged all their COVID-19 patients, giving the impression that they are now free of the disease. Government also frowned at the general lack of compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols, lamenting how Nigerians now wear facemasks only to evade arrest rather than as a safety measure to halt the spread of the virus. These were disclosed on Monday in Abuja during the daily briefing of the Presidential Taskforce PTF on Covid-19. Director-General, Nigerian Centre for Disease Control NCDC, Dr Chikwe Iheakwazu said no state in the country can yet be declared Covid-19 free even if they have discharged all their Covid-19 patients.
