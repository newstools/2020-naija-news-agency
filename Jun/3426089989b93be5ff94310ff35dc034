The latest word stemming from the French media suggests that Manchester City’s hopes of landing Lyon star Houssem Aouar may be dealt a blow by the club’s ban from European competition. Aouar, a gifted 21-year-old midfielder, has been on the books of Lyon since 2009. He broke into the first-team ranks of the Ligue 1 giants for the first time at the beginning of 2017, and has since gone on to establish himself as one of the most highly-regarded young talents in French football. Aouar is regularly lauded for his technical ability and creative flair, and has already been likened to Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta during his fledgling career. However, the French U21-international is also not afraid to stick a foot in when required, making Aouar a highly-desirable, all-round modern midfielder. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1036083884-1024x689.jpg?resize=1024%2C689&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Houssem Aouar of Lyon runs with the ball during the Group F match of the UEFA Champions League between Manchester City and Olympique Lyonnais at Etihad Stadium on September 19, 2018 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Thus far, the outfit most persistently-linked with a move for the Lyon man have been Italian champions Juventus. Recent months, however, have seen Manchester City position themselves firmly alongside the Bianconeri in the race for Aouar, with Pep Guardiola thought to be a huge fan of the midfielder’s talents. In fact, reports stemming from France late in April went as far as to suggest that the Sky Blues were set to open imminent negotiations with Lyon over Aouar’s signature. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1065896902-1024x710.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LYON, FRANCE – NOVEMBER 27: David Silva of Manchester City battles for possession with Houssem Aouar of Olympique Lyonnais during the UEFA Champions League Group F match between Olympique Lyonnais and Manchester City at Groupama Stadium on November 27, 2018 in Lyon, France. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) As outlined above, though, if the latest word emerging from the French media over the last 48 hours is to be believed, City’s hopes of striking a summer deal for the talented 21-year-old appear to have been dealt a blow. As revealed by Jeremy Smith of talkSPORT (citing L’Equipe), Aouar would actually favour a move to the Etihad over Juventus. What could cost the former, however, is the club’s European ban. As things stand, Man City will be banned from participating in either the Champions League or Europa League for the next two seasons, after being found guilty of breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. This, in turn, has handed Juve the chance to ‘up the charm offensive’, with Aouar understandably not keen on sacrificing the opportunity to showcase his talents on the grandest stage in club football for two years straight: Equipe confirm Lyon will still allow Houssem Aouar to leave this summer despite covid-19 likely delaying things. Manchester City or Juventus the 2 contenders tho neither have begun talks. Aouar prefers City but threat of a CL ban is giving Juve a chance to up the charm offensive. — Jeremy Smith (@jeremysmith98) June 1, 2020 RMC Sport, meanwhile, have provided a further insight into the situation, adding Liverpool and PSG to the list of Aouar’s admirers: RMC reporting that PSG and Liverpool, as well as Manchester City and Juventus, are keen on Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar, whom OL are happy to sell this summer and for whom they are looking for a minimum of €50 million. — Jeremy Smith (@jeremysmith98) June 2, 2020 Premier League clubs given ‘green light’ to hold friendlies ahead of season’s return Mikel Arteta to ‘take matters into his own hands’ to keep hold of Aubameyang/Arsenal yet to table contract offer Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
