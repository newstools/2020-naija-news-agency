The Mirror have reported on Sunday that Arsenal have sacked an unspecified amount of European scouts in recent days: Arsenal are culling several senior continental scouts in another round of cuts. The Gunners have informed a number of their spies who are working abroad that their employment will be terminated. With such little detail provided on which scouts have been axed, and in which regions, it’s difficult to draw too many conclusions on the possible impact of this decision. However, many may assume it’s a sign that Arsenal won’t be particularly active in the upcoming transfer windows. EXCLUSIVE: Arsenal now terminate contracts of scouts across Europe amid continued cuts https://t.co/rhmBFMoT9t pic.twitter.com/qFipN3KEb5 — Mirror Football (@MirrorFootball) June 6, 2020 Back in February, Arsenal’s latest accounts showed a £27.1 million loss. That was the first time Arsenal had announced an operating loss since 2002. Arsenal have an annual wage bill of £230 million, while they’ve only been playing Europa League football in recent seasons. Moreover, the Gunners are only 9th in the current Premier League campaign, so they’re not returning to the Champions League anytime soon. Considering the current economic implications during the Covid-19 pandemic – reduced TV payouts, no gate receipts – it feels understandable why Arsenal’s finances going forward are set to be restricted. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1191153156-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s Spanish head coach Mikel Arteta (R) speaks with Arsenal’s Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (L) during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 1, 2020.

On Saturday, Arsenal’s first team returned to action at the Emirates Stadium for the first time since March, in a behind closed doors game against Charlton. Charlton were without their top scorer, Lyle Taylor, who has refused to play for the Addicks as he’s a free agent in the summer. Arsenal won the match 6-0, and their star strikers Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both found the target. Aubameyang found the net with a curler, while Lacazette’s goal was arguably the pick of the lot.

Before football stopped in March, Nketiah had scored three goals in six appearances as he filled in while Lacazette was suspended.
