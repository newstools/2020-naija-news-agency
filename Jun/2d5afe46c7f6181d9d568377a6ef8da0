There’s one Premier League match on Monday as Crystal Palace host Burnley. This is a clash between 10th and 11th in the league. Both sides have 42 points. Palace come into the game following a 4-0 loss at Liverpool. The Eagles won 4 matches in a row beforehand. Burnley beat Watford 1-0 thanks to a Jay Rodriguez winner. That win was Burnley’s first in four games. Also see: Crystal Palace vs Burnley FC live streaming & betting tips. Burnley’s build-up to the Palace game has been shrouded in questions about Sean Dyche’s ongoing future at Turf Moor. According to the Telegraph’s James Ducker, Dyche is involved in a power struggle with the club’s owner, Mike Garlick. Readers are told: The football plan and the business plan have not, as several sources put it, “come together” as Dyche hoped and this damaging disconnect has now led to talk of the manager potentially departing this summer. This inertia that has exasperated Dyche may be partly explained by suggestions Garlick is close to selling the club. Prospective investors have been circling and there have even been whispers among board members of a sale this summer. One of the strongest manager-dynamics in the PL has hit the rocks, and had been deteriorating for some time. There’s no villain, though. A closer look at the power struggle between Sean Dyche & Mike Garlick at #BurnleyFC as talk of club sale intensifies https://t.co/qyGV0qaH1d — James Ducker (@TelegraphDucker) June 29, 2020 Dyche outlined some of his frustrations at Turf Moor in his pre-match presser before the Crystal Palace game. In it, the Burnley manager made it clear that the Clarets need to start spending if they hope to stay relevant in the division. Dyche said: The days of us nicking Nick Pope for £1.5 million, Johan Gudmundsson for £2.2 million, James Tarkowski for £4 million and Andre Gray for £6 million, they’ve gone. We’re not sure how Covid-19 is going to affect the market, but if you took that away, I have said for a long time that we need to get in front of the curve. But doing that costs a lot of money. It’s a vicious circle. That’s why for 2½ years, I’ve been talking about stretching it — not breaking it. Can we do it? Yes. Does it need stretching? Yes, it does. You can’t forever just work on a net spend of £9 million a year. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1052191392.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dean Smith" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 15: Dean Smith manager of Aston Villa during a press conference at Villa Park Stadium on October 15, 2018 in Birmingham, England.

According to the Telegraph’s John Percy, Villa manager Dean Smith won’t be sacked before the end of the season. Readers are told: Aston Villa are set to stick with Dean Smith for the final six games. Smith is under increasing pressure as head coach but it is understood that the 49 year old will stay in charge for the remainder of the season.
