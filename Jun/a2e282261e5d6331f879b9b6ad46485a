A recent report from the English media claims that Tottenham are determined to keep hold of all of their key stars this summer. The 2019/20 campaign, to this point, has been one to forget for Tottenham. Under the now-departed Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs were ousted from the League Cup by Colchester, and looked extremely unlikely to qualify for European competition next term. Jose Mourinho was then brought in to try to revive the Lilywhites’ campaign. But after a brief upturn in form under the Portuguese tactician, Spurs, prior to the postponement of football due to COVID-19, were once again in a rather dire situation. The capital giants were knocked out of the FA Cup and Champions League in March, amid a six-game winless run across all competitions. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1190403101-1024x773.jpg?resize=1024%2C773&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 26: Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur during the UEFA Champions League group B match between Tottenham Hotspur and Olympiacos FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on November 26, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

And should Spurs lose to Manchester United on Friday, that would no doubt prove a huge blow to their already diminishing hopes of securing Champions League football for next season. Should Spurs fail to clinch a Champions League spot, and perhaps even a place in the Europa League, one would imagine that some of their top talents will wish to move on. However, if the aforementioned report from the Telegraph is to be believed, then such exits will not be forthcoming. It is claimed that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is determined not to sell any of Tottenham’s star players this summer, even in the event that the north Londoners miss out on a Champions League spot. This presumably includes Harry Kane, who hinted just a few months ago that his Tottenham future is dependent on how Spurs progress as a side.
