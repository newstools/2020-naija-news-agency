Matt Law of the Telegraph has today provided an update on the contract situation of Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Gabonese hitman Aubameyang has been on the books of Arsenal for almost two-and-a-half years now. The 30-year-old made the move to north London from Borussia Dortmund in January of 2018, for a then-club-record fee of £56 million. And to say that he has since gone on to prove himself a hit would be putting it lightly. All told, across 97 appearances in the red of Arsenal, Aubameyang has found the net a hugely-impressive 61 times, marking a ratio of just under 2 goals every 3 games. In fact, his 50th strike for the Gunners, which came back in November versus Wolves, saw ‘Auba’ etch his name into the history books of the capital giants: @Aubameyang7 for @Arsenal: 78 Games 50 Goals 12 Assists The fastest player to reach 50 goals for @Arsenal since @IanWright0. pic.twitter.com/IK9nhTw0g0 — SPORF (@Sporf) November 2, 2019 Aubameyang’s ever-increasing importance to the Arsenal cause, meanwhile, also saw the pacy attacker rewarded in November. After former boss Unai Emery announced that Granit Xhaka had been stripped of the club’s captaincy, the Spanish tactician opted to name Aubameyang as his side’s new leader.

With the Gunners again looking likely to miss out on Champions League football for next season, the African was hotly-tipped for a Barcelona switch this past January, with a fresh Blaugrana swoop in the summer not ruled out. The mounting question marks surrounding Aubameyang’s future come with the prolific attacker’s contract quickly winding down in north London. As things stand, Arsenal’s talisman has just a year remaining on his current deal. Recent days, meanwhile, have seen claims widely vary in the media regarding negotiations between Aubameyang and the Gunners. Just yesterday, French outlet L’Equipe suggested that those in charge at the Emirates had tabled an offer of fresh terms to their no. 14. Such claims, though, have since been firmly denied elsewhere, hinting further at an imminent divorce between Arsenal and Aubameyang. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192950708-1024x697.jpg?resize=1024%2C697&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 09: Nicolas Pepe of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his sides second goal with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during the Premier League match between West Ham United and Arsenal FC at London Stadium on December 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Law backs those who insist that the Gunners are in fact yet to offer a new contract to their star striker. This is attributed in no small part, though, to the widespread delays caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Significantly, meanwhile, it is also added that Mikel Arteta has not yet given up hope of convincing Aubameyang to stay put. The Arsenal boss is said to be ready to ‘take matters into his own hands’, by holding one-on-one talks with the African, over his plans moving forward: ‘Arteta is desperate to keep the club’s top scorer and build a young and vibrant team around him.’ ‘With that in mind, Arteta is preparing to initiate talks and hopes to impress the 30-year-old and his father. Rather than leaving the matter in the hands of the club’s contract and transfer chiefs, Arteta believes he can make a difference by taking a hands-on approach to Aubameyang’s future.’ Arteta is ready to make Aubameyang’s future personal by leading talks over trying to convince him to sign a new contract #afc https://t.co/Iy33dVZGiM — Matt Law (@Matt_Law_DT) June 2, 2020 Inter’s Lautaro Martinez to sign a 5-year deal with Barcelona ‘Very high’ chance David Luiz will be at Arsenal next season Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
