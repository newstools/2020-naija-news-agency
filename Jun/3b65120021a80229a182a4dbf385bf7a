The Lagos State University and Morgan State University graduate of Sociology teamed up with the Vision 2020 crooner, Bella Shmurda to give this wonderful jam. The self-acclaimed ”Lyrical Punchbag” dropped his EP #BookOfSTR last December, a piece of work that has the likes of MohBad, Dhymn, Mo’Jay, and Terry Apala on it. Like always, STR delivered a well fabricated lyrics filled with punchlines and like you already know, Bella Shmurda did not disappoint either. Juwonlo is a Yoruba word meaning “More Than Them”. Juwonlo was produced and engineered by Taleen Beatz.
