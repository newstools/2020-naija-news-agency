According to the NBC broadcasting code 6th edition amendment: The amendments of the Code make provisions for local content in the broadcast industry. It also makes provisions for increased advertising revenue for local broadcast stations and content producers. It significantly creates restrictions for monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour in the broadcast industry in Nigeria. Which means: How Nollywood stars and executives are reacting to the news: The CEO of iROKOtv, Jason Njoku has said that NBC will destroy PayTV services in Nigeria if it implements the recently released revised edition of the 6th Broadcast Code. Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) In making exclusivity illegal, compelling sub-licensing of content & regulating price, are effectively turning private enterprise into state property. Interference Distorts Markets. If implemented this 100% destroys PayTV in Nigeria. Under these proposed terms it makes zero sense for @irokotv @ROK_DSTV @NetflixNaija @irokotv @africamagictv @FilmhouseCinema @SilverbirdTV @SceneoneTV or any other platform or independent production house to invest in local content. Zero sense. No consultation no thought. Nothing. This our champagne socialism & zero input style of policy making is the reason Nigeria is stunted in everything. I invest billions Naira in content then I am compelled to share with everyone else as NBC sets the price Why? Dark forces or incompetence is at play here. Ridiculous. For ‘national emergencies’ 20% of broadcast hours should be dedicated to well. The government. Nationalization in everything but name. So if @Tyson_Fury vs @anthonyfjoshua fight is to be shown in Nigeria. Equivalent of 30% of the license costs need to be invested in an equivalent local sport? Who will pay for that? Maybe ABC vs XYZ works for some but who will pay for it? Arise o compatriots, Nigeria call obey. This is for you Nigeria and Nigerians. This is the patriotism you voted for. Anything you ‘enjoy’ you just now pay more for it. You think 15% inflation is high. Wait o. Soon CNN will leave it’s daily programming to show Arrival of Orji Kalu and APC and PDP conventions. Essentially be ready for NTA everywhere. This is a highest priority for NBC. HIGHEST. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EaJz_T5WsAAJAA9.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-3.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-3.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Ruth Kadiri on her Instagram page stated that this new policy will have an adverse effect on the Nollywood industry. My content is about to be taken from me. The right to sell MY content and who to sell to, and how much to sell it, is about to be taken from me ! If creativity is easy why aren’t you creating yours why are you trying to take mine from me. When I needed funds to make my movies you weren’t there. It’s heartbreaking that at the end of you. You’re planning on taking food from the mouths of 42 people that I pay monthly. Cast and crew. Your policies will end up chasing out companies who buy our content and the suffering in Nigeria/Nollywood will increase.
