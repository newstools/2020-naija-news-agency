Dejan Lovren has provided an insight into his current mindset, as the Liverpool star continues to be tipped for a summer exit from the club. The future of Reds’ stopper Lovren has been the subject of intense speculation for some time now. On the back of a difficult campaign last time out, during which the Croatian managed just 11 Premier League starts, reports were rife throughout the summer that Liverpool had opened to the idea of allowing Lovren to move on. Jurgen Klopp will let Dejan Lovren leave Liverpool if interested clubs are ready to meet a valuation which will rise to £20m. Klopp will take such a risky decision because of his complete faith in the talented Ki-Jana Hoever, writes @MaddockMirror https://t.co/RozcJc7kRK — Anfield Watch (@AnfieldWatch) August 13, 2019 In the end, however, a lack of sufficient offers eventually saw the 30-year-old forced to stay put. And the 2019/20 campaign has again proven less than fruitful for Lovren from a playing standpoint. A combination of injury troubles and competition for places has seen the former Lyon man notch starts in just 9 of Liverpool’s 29 league fixtures thus far. As such, speculation surrounding Lovren’s future at Anfield has inevitably begun to resurface of late. Reports earlier this year even saw Arsenal and Tottenham named as surprise suitors of the Croatian international. A host of Serie A clubs are also thought to be keeping a close eye on Lovren’s situation. If the latest comments on the part of the experienced stopper himself are anything to go by, though, then Lovren’s focus remains very much on Liverpool’s Premier League title run-in. Speaking in an interview with Sky Sports earlier today, the out-of-favour Reds stopper was drawn on his place in the defensive pecking order at Anfield, as well as the speculation surrounding his future. Lovren, though, assured that his eyes remain firmly fixed on securing the English top-flight crown, only after which he will ‘see what happens’: ‘I’m always ready. If someone is injured and coming off, I’m ready to step in and show my quality. I think I proved that last season, when Joe Gomez or Joel Matip were injured and I came in and played.’ ‘My goal is to play and to win as many trophies as possible. But at the moment the focus is just to win the next two games and be champions. After that, we will see what happens.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1190476835-1024x721.jpg?resize=1024%2C721&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 27: Dejan Lovren of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League group E match between Liverpool FC and SSC Napoli at Anfield on November 27, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

To be honest, I’m not too bothered. If I feel criticism, it will be first from the manager, but my biggest critic is me.’ ‘I can see when I perform well or not, it’s as simple as that, I don’t need somebody to tell me. I don’t read a lot of newspapers or listen much to the pundits.’ ‘It is what it is. It’s football and we have to deal with it. Some players can’t do that and they go inside themselves, but accepting it is important. The criticism will just make me stronger. It has always been part of football and it always will be part of football.’ Tottenham vs Manchester United scheduled for Friday June 19 & when 2019-20 Premier League fixture list will be confirmed Timo Werner ‘has decided against’ Liverpool/Leipzig star reportedly close to joining Chelsea Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
