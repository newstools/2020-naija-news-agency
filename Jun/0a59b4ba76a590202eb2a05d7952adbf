An explanation for the delay in Chelsea’s swoop for RB Leipzig star Timo Werner has been forthcoming online, with a deal now expected to be completed by this weekend. Versatile attacker Werner has enjoyed a scintillating campaign to date, during which the German has directly contributed to 33 goals in 30 Bundesliga appearances. This includes 4 goals in his last 4 outings, and a a hat-trick late last month, as Leipzig put Mainz to the sword by 5 goals to nil. And there it is!

Watch the Bundesliga live on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 24, 2020 Werner has also found the back of the net on 4 occasions during this season’s Champions League campaign, including a crucial last-16 first-leg strike versus Tottenham. This level of production, meanwhile, inevitably resulted in widespread recent speculation that Werner was being eyed up by some of European football’s heavyweights ahead of the opening of the summer transfer window. The outfit most persistently touted as a potential destination, up until last week, had been Premier League giants Liverpool. The Reds were long viewed as overwhelming favourites to clinch a deal for the Leipzig standout, with reports having even gone as far as to suggest that Jurgen Klopp held a ‘virtual meeting’ with Werner over Easter. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1207353498-1024x775.jpg?resize=1024%2C775&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 19: Giovani Lo Celso of Tottenham Hotspur and Timo Werner of RB Leipzig during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg match between Tottenham Hotspur and RB Leipzig at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on February 19, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

This day last week, the Blues stole a march on the competition for Werner, after it was revealed that Roman Abramovich and co. had agreed to fork over the required £53 million to activate the versatile attacker’s release clause. Confirmation was subsequently forthcoming that Werner himself had also agreed to a deal with Chelsea, with a transfer having been viewed as imminent. To this point, however, an official announcement regarding Werner’s Stamford Bridge switch has not been forthcoming. This had understandably led to concern amongst the Chelsea faithful, as supporters of the Londoners brace themselves for potential last-minute competition from other interested parties. But, as outlined above, the Chelsea fanbase need not fret. As revealed by Jack Rosser of the Evening Standard, the delay in confirmation of Werner’s move to the English capital is purely down to the process being slowed by COVID-19 restrictions. It is far from straightforward to organise a medical at present, considering the state of affairs in the UK. However, such formalities are expected to be carried out this weekend, with Chelsea’s deal for Werner due to be announced by Monday at the latest.

Croatian midfielder Pasalic has spent the last 2 seasons on loan with Serie A outfit Atalanta, where the 25-year-old has gone on to establish himself as a key member of the club’s first-team picture. And, speaking in an interview with Sky Italia this week, Orobici sporting director Giovanni Sartori confirmed that the high-flying Italian outfit intend to take up their £13.5 million option to purchase Pasalic outright this summer: ‘We’re going to buy Mario Pasalic on a permanent deal from Chelsea.
