Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has hit out at the standard of officiating during his side’s hard-fought draw with Manchester United. Mourinho’s Spurs welcomed the Red Devils to north London last night, for the respective clubs’ first outing following the COVID-19 outbreak. The matchup marked a crucial one in the Premier League’s battle for Europe, with 5th-placed United having held the advantage over their hosts ahead of kick-off. When all was said and done in the English capital, though, an entertaining affair eventually saw both sides forced to settle for a point. It was Tottenham who took the lead in the clash, when a moment of individual brilliance from Steven Bergwijn (coupled with some shoddy David de Gea shot-stopping) saw the Dutch wide-man rifle home just before the half-hour mark. Strength in depth proved crucial for United, though, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having had the luxury of introducing the likes of Mason Greenwood, Odion Ighalo and Paul Pogba off the bench. And it was the latter of these stars who’s superb piece of footwork 10 minutes from time earned the Red Devils a penalty, which was dully dispatched by midfield partner Bruno Fernandes to see the evening’s spoils shared. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1221106643-1-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JUNE 19: Paul Pogba of Manchester United during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on June 19, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

Incredibly, after Bruno Fernandes went to ground in the hosts’ box under a challenge from Eric Dier just minutes from time, Jon Moss pointed to the spot once more. A subsequent VAR check, however, saw the decision swiftly overturned, with it clear that there had been little to no contact between the pair. Jose Mourinho, despite VAR having in the end made the right call, though, was nevertheless left fuming with the decisions which went against his side last night. Speaking in the matchup’s aftermath, the Tottenham boss was keen to highlight Manchester United’s ‘incredible record with penalties’ (stat showcased below), as well as hinting that his former club’s first penalty should also have been overturned: ‘We knew that we could have a penalty against and we were very careful with it. We know Manchester United has an incredible record with penalties given this season and we knew that everything in the box was very dangerous for us.’ 23 – Since the start of last season, Manchester United have been awarded 23 penalties in the Premier League – nine more than any other team.

We knew it could happen.’ ‘I think the first penalty the referee Jonathan made this decision, which I admit is difficult for referees. Then the VAR is a different story.’ ‘Referees can make mistakes but I don’t think VAR should make mistakes.’ Mourinho also went on to suggest that Bruno Fernandes should have been shown a yellow card for playacting in his attempts to win United’s 2nd spot-kick, another decision which left the Portuguese tactician ‘upset’: ‘Then the second penalty is incredible for me. Its a foul on Serge Aurier that should kill the situation.’ ‘Then it’s a foul in the box and I feel when VAR goes for simulation the player should be exposed and get a yellow card. But that didn’t happen.’ ‘I feel really upset with these two decisions but that’s how it is.’ Top Premier League clubs expected to sit out next season’s League Cup Richarlison names 3 defenders he feels are better than Virgil van Dijk ahead of Merseyside derby Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
