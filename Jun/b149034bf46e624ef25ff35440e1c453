Some Premier League clubs have played no friendly plans. Others are only playing themselves. A couple are playing two in a day. Arsenal Who they’ve played:June 5: 6-0 v Charlton (Lacazette, Aubameyang, Nketiah x3, Willock)June 10: 2-3 v Brentford (Willock, Lacazette) What they’ve said:“We are trying different things, we are trying to give minutes in the legs to all the players. We have had to change a lot of players through the games. We are getting adapted to playing in an empty stadium as well and losing that energy from the fans. It was good, we played two friendlies and we are getting the rhythm, we haven’t played for a while. We tried to make it as close as possible to a real Premier League game” – Mikel Arteta. First game back:Manchester City, June 17 (a) Aston Villa Who they’ve played:June 6: 2-2 v West Brom (Davis, Grealish)June 10: two friendlies against Leicester, one a reported 1-0 defeat at Villa Park and the other a supposed 3-0 win at the King Power Stadium, during which Trezeguet scored this lovely goal. حصريًا لـ جمهور  التالتة.. هدف تريزيجيه الرائع في شباك اليوم أمام ليستر سيتي pic.twitter.com/Q1P7vYpAxz — OnTime Sports (@ONsportEg) June 10, 2020 First game back:Sheffield United, June 17 (h) Bournemouth Who they’ve played:No-one, it seems. As clubs cannot travel more than 90 minutes for friendlies, Bournemouth are automatically a bit hamstrung. But the Daily Echo has reported that Eddie Howe has overseen two intra-club friendlies thus far. First game back:Crystal Palace, June 20 (h) Brighton Who they’ve played:That story is much the same for Brighton. There has been a suggestion that they could face Portsmouth but nothing has come to fruition. What they’ve said:“The boys have come back in a really good way and I’d say we’ve had the best three weeks training since I’ve been at the club. The performance, attitude and quality has been really high. We’ve had a long and frustrating period out which wasn’t nice to go through but people lost their lives and that puts things into perspective. But now we’ve got the go-ahead to play we want to be out there. We have nine tough games left which is the challenge of the competition, but I’m really happy with how the players have approached the return” – Graham Potter. First game back:Arsenal, June 20 (h) Burnley Who they’ve played:No-one different yet. Wigan are lined up for a friendly on Tuesday, June 16. What they’ve said:“We have had some clearance to play some friendly games which opens up another guideline to bring you back to a bit more of a normal situation. That will be from next week. We are working on the idea of having a game the Saturday before the season starts again. We’ve had a couple of bigger pitch scenarios where we’ve played a full-sided game and that will continue on the Saturday this week, building up for real fitness. We’re quite happy with the fitness levels and now it’s getting your eye in and the sharpness” – Sean Dyche. First game back:Manchester City, June 22 (a) Chelsea Who they’ve played:June 6: an intra-squad friendly. The details are sketchy but Ruben Loftus-Cheek did a goal. That’s some way towards an answer. June 10: 1-0 v Reading (Pedro) Reading FC is today at Cobham then QPR is at the weekend https://t.co/j4toFgvspK — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) June 10, 2020 First game back:Aston Villa, June 21 (a) Crystal Palace Who they’ve played:No-one yet. Opposing clubs seem reluctant to risk having their confidence shattered by Jordan Ayew. What they’ve said:“I must give the players enormous credit. They’re working on their own, no help from anybody. Some of them had a field nearby which was suitable, and some didn’t. It’s quite incredible that they’ve kept themselves in the shape they came back in. That has put us in a position where, today, if you take their pure physicality, I think we’re at a good level. We’ve got the whole squad coming in together so basically we are back with the view to building up to the match in two weeks’ time, just working with the squad and training every bit in the same way as we would have done before the lockdown started” – Roy Hodgson. First game back:Bournemouth, June 20 (a) Everton Who they’ve played:Not a great deal has come out of Goodison Park, aside from reports of a friendly against Preston on June 12. Don’t read everything you see on Twitter, mind. Everton played a behind closed doors friendly against Liverpool this afternoon and ran out 6-3 winners. Liverpool led 3-0 at halftime but a second half double hat trick from Niasse gave Everton the spoils — <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1e7-1f1f7.png?ssl=1" alt="🇧🇷" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Thanks to the Leicester Mercury – ‘It means Leicester’s players are now increasingly more accustomed to the matchday environment – in largely empty arenas – which awaits them upon the resumption of the Premier League’ – for that. What they’ve said:“We’ll look at trying to prepare as best we can. We’ll have some practice games in our own stadium before we play, so they’ll feel and get a sense of that. The game is not the same. It’s absolutely not, it can’t be. However, it’s what we have to do. The intensity and commitment of the players will still be there. We’d obviously love our supporters to be there but there won’t be any. We’ll have a cause we’ll be fighting for. It will be strange, it will be different. But we’ll find ways to cope with that and we’ll look to get the job done” – Brendan Rodgers. First game back:Watford, June 20 (a) Liverpool Who they’ve played:June 10: 6-0 v Blackburn (Keita, Mane, Minamino, Matip, Hoever, Clarkson) As reported by Neil Jones of Goal, Liverpool ‘are expected to play at least one more friendly before they resume their league campaign away at Everton a week on Sunday.’ What they’ve said:“It was not only a workout; for us, it was a really important test and we wanted the players to go for 45 minutes [but] because of a few little issues we couldn’t do that, so we didn’t have enough ‘first-team players’, I would say, so that’s why we decided to let three players go for 60 minutes. That’s OK. It looked really good, obviously. It looked really good, pretty much from the beginning” – Jurgen Klopp. First game back:Everton, June 21 (a) Manchester City Who they’ve played:Good luck finding any information on the champions’ restart preparations. Club groundsman Lee Jackson did tweet the following picture of an intra-squad game in which Leroy Sane played. Remember him? #ManCity have played a friendly at the Etihad Stadium this morning involving players from the first-team squad.

Reports on this one are confusing as the scorers were originally recorded as Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford (x3), Bruno Fernandes (x2), Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay. Then Luke Shaw came out and said he, Rashford and Odion Ighalo scored twice, with Fernandes and Daniel James getting the other goals. Either way, how about that defence?June 9: Not Stoke.June 12: two friendlies are scheduled against West Brom at Old Trafford, according to the Daily Telegraph, with the first at 1pm and the second at 3pm. First game back:Tottenham, June 19 (a) Newcastle Who they’ve played:June 6: 1-1 v Newcastle (Joelinton, Bentaleb)June 9: 3-2 v Middlesbrough (Muto, Almiron, Joelinton)June 13: a friendly is scheduled against Hull. What they’ve said:“They have had eight weeks off and that is probably the longest break some of these players have had in their careers. If we’re doing pre-season, we would have six weeks and probably have six friendly games to get them ready for the first league match. So, we need a good stretch of time here to get them ready. We need enough preparation to get these players into shape or they are just going to fall down like a pack of cards. Most of the managers have the same concerns. We would need at least six weeks. I don’t see how we can play games until the back end of June” – Steve Bruce. First game back:Sheffield United, June 21 (h) Norwich Who they’ve played:June 9: 3-3 v Norwich (Idah, Pukki, Klose, Drmic, Duda x2)June 12: a friendly is scheduled against Tottenham. What they’ve said:“At the moment in these strange times, we have to live day to day and make a decision from day to day. But, if we’re allowed and it’s confirmed under which circumstances we’re allowed, for example, if you’re allowed to use the stadiums to play a friendly. At the moment, it seems like we are allowed to play friendlies before the start – something the Bundesliga didn’t allow and I think that was not perfect” – Daniel Farke. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f680.png?ssl=1" alt="🚀" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f4a5.png?ssl=1" alt="💥" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 𝔾𝕆𝔸𝕃𝕊 <img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f4a5.png?ssl=1" alt="💥" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f680.png?ssl=1" alt="🚀" data-recalc-dims="1" /> All  goals from today's training game including a screamer from Timm Klose! <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f633.png?ssl=1" alt="😳" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f44f.png?ssl=1" alt="👏" data-recalc-dims="1" /> pic.twitter.com/VGIVO5wgUf — Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) June 9, 2020 First game back:Southampton, June 19 (h) Sheffield United Who they’ve played:June 6: Thanks to The Athletic, who tell us ‘Huddersfield Town were the visitors for what was agreed beforehand to be two 60-minute matches. United ran out 2-0 winners in the first game before being held to a 2-2 draw…it is understood Sharp and McGoldrick were among the goals.’June 9: 4-0 v Hull (Fleck, Zivkovic, Lundstram x2) A final friendly against Barnsley will be held before the Premier League resumes. First game back:Aston Villa, June 17 (a) Southampton Who they’ve played:As with Bournemouth, they’re a bit out of the way and details are scarce. First game back:Norwich, June 19 (a) Tottenham Who they’ve played:No-one just yet, but… June 12: a friendly is scheduled against Norwich.June 13: a friendly is scheduled against Reading. Hearing that Spurs could host Reading in a friendly on Saturday, the day after the game against Norwich. The thinking would be to give Jose Mourinho the opportunity to hand another set of 11 players (and subs) the chance to build their match fitness and sharpness. — Alasdair Gold (@AlasdairGold) June 10, 2020 First game back:Manchester United, June 19 (h) Watford Who they’ve played:No-one just yet, but… June 13: a friendly is scheduled against Brentford, because Nigel Pearson is a hero and simply wants to see Hornets take on Bees. First game back:Leicester, June 20 (h) West Ham Who they’ve played:June 10: 4-1 v QPR (Ajeti, Haller, Masuaku, Antonio) Arsenal and Crystal Palace have also been approached as West Ham have already played both twice this Premier League season. What they’ve said:“Of course, we will be playing some friendlies. We’ll do everything we can to prepare for the return of the Premier League. If you consider this a sort of pre-season period, most teams would have had a few friendlies under their belts and one thing all the clubs are not going to get is a lot of game practice, so I think getting the opportunity to do that means we can play a couple of games behind closed doors. Of course, we’re not going to ask other teams to travel a long distance and we don’t intend to travel a long distance as we are all following the guidelines while we’re in a position where we don’t want anything to go wrong in the lead up to the restart of the Premier League” – David Moyes. West Ham had an intra-squad match at London Stadium yesterday, Andriy Yarmolenko, Tomas Soucek and Ryan Fredericks featured, as did Ben Johnson and Jeremy Ngakia. The Hammers are set to play QPR in a friendly on Wednesday. #WHUFC — Sam Inkersole (@Sam_InkersoleTM) June 7, 2020 First game back:Wolves, June 20 (h) Wolves June 9: 0-2 v Nottingham ForestJune 13: a friendly is scheduled against Birmingham.
