In the Times on Wednesday, speculation is ratcheted up over the likelihood that Jan Vertonghen never plays for Tottenham again. Vertonghen joined Spurs from Ajax back in 2012. However, the Belgian has never lifted a major trophy with the Lillywhites. On June 30, Vertonghen’s deal with Tottenham expirers. And, according to reporter Gary Jacob, Jose Mourinho should be prepared to field a team without Vertonghen for the remainder of the 2019-20 season: The Belgium defender, 33, is out of contract on June 30 and is yet to decide whether to sign a temporary contract on the same financial terms for July to cover the rest of the campaign. The Times also confirm that Tottenham will not offer Vertonghen a new deal to stay at the club, despite the fact the defender was “keen to commit his future to Spurs”. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1071856254-1024x680.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jan Vertonghen" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – DECEMBER 11: Jan Vertonghen of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates after the UEFA Champions League Group B match between FC Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur at Camp Nou on December 11, 2018 in Barcelona, Spain.

According to the Athletic, Fraser, “who is one of Bournemouth’s highest earners, (is) in a difficult position”. The Athletic note that “Fraser will not be short of suitors this summer,” so the midfielder needs to weigh up the possibility of sustaining a bad injury in the final weeks of the season, or whether to refuse to play to help try to ensure a move to another Premier League club. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1063931708-1024x735.jpg?resize=1024%2C735&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ryan Fraser" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GLASGOW, SCOTLAND – NOVEMBER 20: Ryan Fraser of Scotland runs with the ball during the UEFA Nations League C group one match between Scotland and Israel at Hampden Park on November 20, 2018 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images) On the possible buyers for Ryan Fraser, the Athletic suggest that Arsenal and Tottenham have faded into the background: Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are the notable names to have been linked with Fraser in recent weeks but neither are thought to view him as a priority — for now. None of the other big clubs in the league, for example Chelsea, Man United or Leicester, are linked with Fraser either. Instead, the Athletic believe that some of the current midtable sides in the division will be leading the chase to sign Fraser: Several Premier League clubs were understood to be interested in Fraser, including Newcastle United and Everton. It is also understood that Crystal Palace and Watford are among those who would like to sign him. But unusually for a player of his repute so close to July, there is no certainty about his future destination, as things stand.
