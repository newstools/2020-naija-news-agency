As confirmed in the Athletic on Tuesday morning, Chelsea will try to sign England international left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester City in the off-season. 23-year-old Chilwell is under contract at the King Power Stadium until 2024. This season, Chilwell has played 23 times for Leicester in the Premier League. He’s scored twice and chipped in with three assists. It’s been widely reported for months that Chelsea are keen on adding Chilwell to their squad. The Athletic today report: Lampard has also made acquiring a new left-back a priority. Despite being linked with many options over the last few months, The Athletic has been assured that Chilwell remains the first choice target. Chilwell will not be cheap as his current contract still has four years left to run. There were suggestions earlier this year that the England international was valued by Leicester at £85 million but Chelsea think the impact of the virus will help lower the fee. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-1023131962-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ben Chilwell" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 25: Shane Long of Southampton and Ben Chilwell of Leicester City battle for the ball during the Premier League match between Southampton FC and Leicester City at St Mary’s Stadium on August 25, 2018 in Southampton, United Kingdom.

The Foxes have billionaire Thai owners, while, sat third in the Premier League, they are on course to compete in next season’s Champions League. Also, if Brendan Rodgers has ambitions of challenging for the league title, he may wish to keep Leicester’s best players at the club. However, Leicester also have a history of selling their stars when their price hits the peak. In recent seasons, Leicester have sold the likes of N’Golo Kante and Harry Maguire as they’ve refreshed their squad in the summer. With that said, the focus will now fall on Chelsea to make Leicester an offer they can’t refuse. What’s clear is that the Blues wish to add a new left-back before next season, but they need to sell before they can buy. The Athletic report: Any move will be dependent on Chelsea being able to offload at least one of Emerson Palmieri and Marcos Alonso, who have struggled for consistency and are under consideration at Inter Milan. There seems to be an acknowledgment in the Athletic that Chelsea may struggle to land Chilwell. Accordingly, the Blues have back-up plans if the Leicester defender is unattainable. Reads are told: Other left-backs, such as Porto’s Alex Telles and Ajax’s Nicolas Tagliafico, have been suggested as cheaper options but it is the Leicester man he wants.

It’s also noted that Juventus are trying to sign Jorginho. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1144056602.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DOETINCHEM, NETHERLANDS – MAY 15: Hakim Ziyech of Ajax during the Dutch Eredivisie match between De Graafschap v Ajax at the De Vijverberg on May 15, 2019 in Doetinchem Netherlands (Photo by Erwin Spek/Soccrates/Getty Images) In general, Chelsea are expected to make two key signings this summer. The Blues, of course, have already bought winger Hakim Ziyech from Ajax. The Athletic announce: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is prepared to back coach Frank Lampard in the transfer market by adding two “marquee” signings to the squad. What’s clear is that Chelsea want to boost their attacking options next season. Fans are told: The club will need a big budget as they have a number of high-profile players on their wishlist. Attacking players and forwards are a particular priority, with Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz, Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Lyon’s Moussa Dembele and RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner all expensive targets.
