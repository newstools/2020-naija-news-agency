Premier League side Chelsea could save a chunk of money on Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz if they choose to pursue the attacker this summer, according to reports. The Blues sealed the signing of Timo Werner on Thursday for £47.5m after weeks of speculation, while they can look forward to welcoming Hakim Ziyech in July too with the Ajax winger agreeing a deal back in January. A report on Thursday hinted that Chelsea could have a clear path to Havertz with other interested clubs not able to pursue the Germany international at this time.

Leverkusen currently occupy the all-important final Champions League spot in the Bundesliga and are one point ahead of fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach with just two matches remaining. On Havertz’s future, Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro recently told German newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger: “Many clubs are interested in him. “I see the player’s wish to take the next step sometime in the near future. “You have to respect that as much as the fact that he has a contract in until 2022.” The post Chelsea ‘could save £20m’ on Havertz transfer on one condition appeared first on Football365.
