Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has recently outlined what he wants to see from Nicola Pepe. Pepe made the switch to north London last summer on the back of a sensational campaign with French outfit, Lille. The winger notched 22 goals and 11 assists in 38 league ties last term, a return that understandably, led to a fairly hefty price-tag being placed on the Ivorian’s head. The fee Arsenal eventually managed to secure Pepe for was a whopping club-record £72m. However, Pepe’s time on the books of the Gunners to date has proved rather disappointing. The 25-year-old has come nowhere near close to matching his previous season’s return and whilst he has shown flashes of quality, Pepe, for the most part, has simply not been up to scratch. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1196188188-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BOURNEMOUTH, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 26: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal looks on prior to the Premier League match between AFC Bournemouth and Arsenal FC at Vitality Stadium on December 26, 2019 in Bournemouth, United Kingdom.

This can be seen by the fact the Spaniard opted to leave Pepe on the bench earlier this week vs Manchester City, despite trailing for most of the game and having five subs available to him, all of which he used. Now though, as outlined above, Arteta has moved to discuss what he expects from Arsenal’s record signing. Speaking ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Brighton on Saturday, Arteta said that it is clear Pepe has not been consistent this campaign, before going on to state that the winger must start producing at his highest level every three days – whilst also being a player who makes a difference for the club: “It’s clear that his consistency has not been at the level he can produce. He’s the first to accept that. That’s what I’m going to demand of a player of his level and calibre. “He has to be producing every three days at the level that he can be. He has to be a player that can make the difference, that is a threat, that generates fear in the opponent and gives us a big threat in the final third. His work rate has to be related as well with that kind of performance. “He knows that. He’s such a nice kid. He’s trying really hard. You have to accept as well, the timing and the way he has adapted for the first year. “A lot has happened for him and we have to understand that. He’s willing and I’m sure we’re going to get the best out of that. I’m convinced of that.” Quotes via football.london.
