The latest word stemming from the media suggests that Barcelona outcast Philippe Coutinho has informed Jurgen Klopp that he would be willing to take a pay cut to return to Liverpool this summer. Brazilian international Coutinho departed Anfield for Spanish giants Barca in January of 2018. The Blaugrana splashed out a reported £142 million on the attack-minded midfielder’s signature, in what, at the time, was viewed as a major coup. As has been widely-documented, however, Barcelona have not exactly reaped the rewards of their massive outlay over the years since. Coutinho largely struggled to replicate his previous brilliance during his time in Catalunya, looking uncharacteristically bereft of confidence when donning the colours of the La Liga champions. This eventually resulted in those in charge at the Camp Nou coming to the decision to cut their losses last summer, when the 27-year-old made the move to German powerhouse Bayern Munich on loan for the 2019/20 campaign. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168377265-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEIPZIG, GERMANY – SEPREMBER 14: Philippe Coutinho of Bayern Muenchen looks on during the Bundesliga match between RB Leipzig and Bayern Muenchen at Red Bull Arena on September 14, 2019 in Leipzig, Germany. (Photo by TF-Images/Getty Images) Coutinho’s time in Bavaria, though, has since also proven largely underwhelming. In fact, the former Inter Milan starlet has managed starts in just 15 of Bayern’s 31 league outings thus far this season. And, if the latest comments on the part of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge are anything to go by, it appears altogether unlikely that Coutinho will still be on the books of the German giants come the start of next season. Speaking in a recent interview with Der Spiegel, Bayern chairman Rummenigge confirmed that the club’s option to purchase their on-loan creator has expired: ‘The option expired and we haven’t activated it.’ ‘We’re going to plan our squad for next season and we’ll see if he still has a role to play with us or not.’ As such, Coutinho’s future, at present, remains completely up in the air. Such uncertainty, meanwhile, has resulted in widespread speculation of late that a Premier League return could be on the cards for the Brazilian. The likes of Chelsea, Manchester United and even Leicester City have all been named as potential destinations for Coutinho in recent months. As outlined above, though, if the latest media chatter is to be believed, then the versatile midfielder himself appears to have set his sights elsewhere. According to the Metro (via Marca), Coutinho is eyeing up a return to former club Liverpool. In fact, the 28-year-old is reported to have made contact with Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, to inform the German that he would be willing to take a pay cut to move back to Anfield. It remains unclear, however, whether interest in a reunion is mutual.
