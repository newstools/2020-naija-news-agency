It’s been confirmed by multiple sources on Sunday that Juventus and Manchester City have agreed a swap deal for teenagers Felix Correia and Pablo Moreno. Indeed, Felix Correia has already been pictured in Italy before his Juve medical. According to Gianluca Di Marzio: The Bianconeri have agreed a deal with Manchester City for the transfer of 19-year-old winger Felix Correia… (and) Juventus’ youngster Pablo Moreno will go the opposite direction. A swap deal between @juventusfc and @ManCity between two young players: #PabloMoreno–#FelixCorreia, medicals today. Moreno will later go on loan to @GironaFC @SkySport @SkySports — Gianluca Di Marzio (@DiMarzio) June 28, 2020 Felix Correia, who never made a first team appearance for City following a move from Sporting CP last summer, is expected to begin his Juve career playing for the U23 side, who are in Serie C. In 2019-20, Felix Correia spent the season on loan at Dutch side AZ. Meanwhile, after signing for Man City, Pablo Moreno will be farmed out to Girona in Spain. Girona, of course, are part of the wider Man City family. Juventus and #ManCity are doing a swap deal that includes Pablo Moreno and Felix Correia. Moreno will then join Girona on loan from #ManCity. Felix is having his Juve medical today.

Also… Jayden Braaf is coming back to join first team training at City. That’s what you call a big opportunity (although obviously Guardiola will play strong teams basically every game) — Sam Lee (@SamLee) June 28, 2020 It’s a busy day for the Juventus medics. Aside from Felix Correia’s medical, Arthur Melo is set for his test on Sunday prior to a move from Barcelona.

Both Juve and Barca have reportedly agreed to complete the deal regardless of that scenario.
