Alan Shearer has warned Chelsea that any new recruits, including Timo Werner, will be expecting to play in the Champions League next season. The Blues have reportedly agreed terms with Werner on a lucrative deal to bring him to Stamford Bridge, while the Premier League side are reportedly willing to pay his release clause at RB Leipzig. Chelsea are currently fourth in the Premier League table but are only three points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, while Wolves and Sheffield United – who have a game in hand – are only two points further back. MEDIAWATCH: Werner STILL joining Liverpool? Just give it up… Shearer told The Sun: “Signing Timo Werner is a huge statement from Chelsea – but it would be a kick in the teeth not to make the top four now. “Along with Hakim Ziyech, they have got two big-hitters through the door before the transfer window has opened. “I am certain there will be more to come, too, with Ben Chilwell also on their radar. “But these players will all be expecting to play in the Champions League next season, so it’s imperative they get the job done. “With a three-point cushion in fourth it would be a real anti-climax if they didn’t, considering the talent on the way in.” The post Chelsea warned over potential ‘kick in the teeth’ amid Werner talk appeared first on Football365.
