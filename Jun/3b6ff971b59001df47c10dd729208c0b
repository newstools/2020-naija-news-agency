Many Nigerians have been arrested and charged to court for flouting the order including Nollywood star, Funke Akindele and her husband, Abdul Bello for hosting a house party. Naira Marley had on Saturday uploaded a video of him and his crew alighting from a chartered plane. The concert by Marley had led to public criticism with many calling for his arrest.   	 		 	<img src="https://i0.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/pjimage-94-2.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />Naira Marley   Lucipost Calling for the arrest of the musician, @utuakpa said “@NCDCgov @PoliceNG PIease arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of that Jabi concert.” @NCDCgov @PoliceNG PIease arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of that Jabi concert. — Nnaemeka Ezeribe (@utuakpa) June 14, 2020 Dear @PoliceNG, Arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of the Jabi Lake concert now.

I call on @PoliceNG to arrest the idiot called Naira Marley and those associated with the concert. If you also attended the concert, you're also an idiot. No apologies — Tekena Alamina (@Tk_Alamina) June 14, 2020 1. Somebody approved the Naira Marley concert2. Somebody approved the non-essential flight to Abuja3. Somebody approved a bottle of hard liquor per ticket4. Somebody didnât stop the concert when it lost control6. Somebody should be sacked this morning…if somebody is serious — Dr. Joe Abah (@DrJoeAbah) June 14, 2020 Pls  @hadisirika investigate the domestic flight that brought Naira Marley to Abuja. Was the flight for humanitarian / pharmaceutical issues @FAAN_Official . We need explanation . — Woye (@woye1) June 14, 2020 Celebrity  Entertainment  Music  PUBLIC HEALTH    News    AddThis  :       Original Author  :   Saharareporters, New York     Disable advertisements  :Original Article
