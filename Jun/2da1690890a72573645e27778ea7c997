The latest speculation stemming from the English media suggests that Manchester United are eyeing Argentine sensation Thiago Almada as a fallback option to Jadon Sancho. Despite the expectation that the opening of the summer transfer window will be delayed, and the financial restrictions set to be brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, speculation surrounding the futures of some of European football’s biggest stars has continued to swirl of late. The likes of Paul Pogba, Philippe Coutinho and Neymar have been hotly-tipped to be on the move this summer, with Manchester United and Barcelona just two of the sides hopeful of securing major reinforcements ahead of next season. Few, if any, though, have been more persistently linked with an imminent exit from their current club than Jadon Sancho. Amid another scintillating campaign with Borussia Dortmund, during which the young Englishman has racked up an eye-watering 20 goals and 20 assists, speculation has been rife that Sancho could be set for a Premier League return.

As things stand, though, it of course remains altogether unclear whether the Red Devils could actually seal a summer deal for Sancho. Dortmund, despite the aforementioned financial obstacles facing clubs this summer, are nevertheless expected to demand a premium fee to part with their prodigious attacker. Such a stance could therefore see Manchester United priced out of a move for Sancho. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DORTMUND, GERMANY – DECEMBER 07: Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal which is later disallowed by VAR during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Duesseldorf at Signal Iduna Park on December 07, 2019 in Dortmund, Germany.

As per a report from the Manchester Evening News, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and co. have identified a number of alternative attacking targets to Sancho. Chief among these, meanwhile, is Velez Sarsfield sensation Thiago Almada. Almada, 19, has previously been dubbed ‘the next Messi’ in his home country of Argentina, and is capable of playing either on the wing or in a more central role. The Albiceleste youth international has racked up 46 appearances at senior level to this point in his fledgling career. The current season has seen Almada look particularly impressive, with the technically-gifted teen having directly contributed to 8 goals across all competitions. And, as per the MEN’s report: ‘Sources in Argentina told MEN Sport of United’s admiration for the player, though the teenager would appear to be a back-up target as things stand.’ Bournemouth’s David Brooks and Schalke talent Rabbi Matondo are also named as potential candidates to make the move to Old Trafford this summer.
