The latest word surrounding Chelsea loanee Mario Pasalic suggests that Atalanta have taken up their option to purchase the midfielder. 25-year-old Pasalic has been on Chelsea’s books since 2014, when he made the move to Stamford Bridge from boyhood club Hajduk Split. Despite the Croatian international having arrived in London amid high expectations, however, he has since failed to make a single Premier League appearance for the Pensioners. Pasalic has been farmed out on 5 consecutive loans, including spells with Monaco and AC Milan. The latest of his temporary stints away from Chelsea, though, has come as by far Pasalic’s most productive to date. In the summer of 2018, the goalscoring midfielder joined Serie A outfit Atalanta on a season-long deal. Pasalic subsequently went on to play a key role in the Dea’s superb campaign, which saw Gian Piero Gasperini’s men shock the masses by clinching a Champions League berth. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1193140386-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Atalanta’s Croatian midfielder Mario Pasalic reacts during the Italian Serie A football match Inter Milan vs Atalanta on January 11, 2020 at the San Siro stadium in Milan.

To this point in the campaign, the 25-year-old has directly contributed to 14 goals across all competitions, as Atalanta continue to defy the odds both domestically and in Europe. And, if the latest speculation surrounding Pasalic is to be believed, then his superb form in Bergamo looks set to result in the gifted midfielder’s time on Chelsea’s books finally coming to an end this summer. As first reported by Italian journalist Nicolo Schira, and since backed by a host of other outlets, Atalanta have taken up their option to purchase Pasalic.
