Olivier Giroud has recently provided some insight into his decision to stay at Chelsea. The 2019/20 campaign began in rather disappointing fashion for Olivier Giroud. The arrival of Frank Lampard to the Chelsea dugout saw the Frenchman’s game time dramatically diminish in the first half of 2019/20. This, unsurprisingly, led to speculation in January that Giroud was set to depart Stamford Bridge. A number of top sides were linked with the former Arsenal standout, including Tottenham and Inter Milan. Giroud himself even admitted in February that he saw himself far away from Chelsea in the winter window. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1207944013-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 22: Olivier Giroud of Chelsea celebrates with teammate Jorginho after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge on February 22, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

In fact, before the season was halted, the hitman had featured in Chelsea’s last four league ties. Despite his upturn in form, Giroud’s future in London still remained somewhat unclear as he had just a few months left on his current contract. However, it was announced in May that the 97-time capped international had penned a one-year extension. And now, as mentioned above, Giroud has recently shed some light on him signing a new deal with the capital giants, citing the coronavirus lockdown as a factor, with the Chelsea forward suggesting he didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of moving abroad: “I simply seized my opportunity and I repaid the faith that the manager had shown in me. “That’s why the club ultimately offered me the chance to continue my time at Chelsea and I accepted immediately because I like it here. I want to keep winning trophies and I want to continue to show the manager that he can count on me. “Plus, with the whole coronavirus lockdown situation, I didn’t really feel comfortable with the idea of moving abroad and uprooting my family. I think a lot about our quality of life and we have a great setup here. I think a lot about my family now.” Quotes via ESPN.
