As am talking to you now, she is lying in coma in Medical Center Afikpo. . And the husband is still bragging outside of the hospital to pounce on her immediately she regains consciousness.

So, I am appealing to well meaning Nigerians, especially organizations who fight domestic violence, to come to her rescue.‚Äù The couple, who got married December 24th, 2015, is blessed with two children.
