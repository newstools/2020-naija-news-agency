MC Galaxy seems to believe that the entertainment industry is run by the Yorubas and dominated only by their tribesmen. The singer said during a recent Instagram live session when he was asked about his opinion on tribal differences in the industry. According to him, their tribalistic behavior is what prevented him from going to major award shows. He said that these Yoruba awards failed to recognize and nominate his hit track “Sekem” which has over 27 million views on Youtube. Galaxy added that he is confident about making this same statement anywhere.
