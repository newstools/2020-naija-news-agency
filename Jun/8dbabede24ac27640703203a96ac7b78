However, the guests who attended exceeded the number of persons stated by the government to be at a gathering. Due to this Funke Akindele, her husband, JJC Skillz, and the “Soapy” singer were arrested by the Nigerian police force for defying the lockdown orders.

According to him, Funke had warned him in the past to stay away from the controversial singer who was arrested for fraud in order to protect his brand.

He wrote: “Funke Akindele said I should stay way from Naira Marley because of my brand. She fucked with Naira Marley and they arrested her.” <img src="https://i0.wp.com/tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/zlatan_ibile_102915383_214060096216948_3205167653994793710_n-scaled.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The post “She F*cked With Naira Marley & They Arrested her”- Zlatan Mocks Funke Akindele appeared first on tooXclusive.
