Juventus star Paulo Dybala has opened up on links to the Premier League, as well as the possibility of lining out alongside Lionel Messi at Barcelona. The major talking point across the European media in the buildup to the English transfer deadline last August surrounded a potential blockbuster swap deal between Juventus and Manchester United. The transfer in question would have seen Romelu Lukaku make the move to Turin, in exchange for Paulo Dybala. Claims even mounted that an agreement between the two clubs was essentially in place. The one major sticking point throughout negotiations, however, was Dybala. Argentine attacker Dybala was rumoured to have had serious reservations over the possibility of joining United, with the Independent having suggested that the 26-year-old doubted the Red Devils’ ability to return to the very top of European football. As such, the board at Old Trafford, in the end, came to the decision to pull the plug on the deal. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1160513428.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SAO PAULO, BRAZIL – JULY 06: Paulo Dybala of Argentina lookson during the Copa America Brazil 2019 Third Place match between Argentina and Chile at Arena Corinthians on July 06, 2019 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Tottenham were also heavily-linked with a move for the Juventus star, with Sky Italia having confirmed that a €70 million deal to send the Argentine to north London was, at one point, in place: Tottenham have agreed a €70m deal with Juventus to sign Paulo Dybala, according to Sky in Italy. — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) August 6, 2019 As had been the case throughout the rumours linking him with a move to Old Trafford, though, Dybala again stood firm in the face of adversity, sticking by his guns to remain a Juventus player. And now, on the back of working his way into the plans of Bianconeri boss Maurizio Sarri, and playing some of his finest football in some time to this point in the current campaign, the South American attacker has provided an insight into the rampant speculation surrounding his name. During an interview with CNN, Dybala was drawn on a host of topics, including links to the Premier League last summer. And the 29-time capped international went on to admit that both Man United and Spurs, along with PSG, at one point expressed an interest in his signature: ‘It was more or less last year at this point when Juventus didn’t want to count on me, didn’t want me to continue playing here.’ ‘That’s when I was contacted and there were some clubs that were interested in me. Among those were Manchester United and Tottenham.’ ‘I think for a long time there were conversations, then Paris Saint-Germain also appeared.’ Dybala himself, though, never actually held discussions with any of the aforementioned clubs: ‘I did not speak directly to any of them, but there were conversations with the clubs. However, my intention at the time was to stay. I hadn’t had a good year or a positive last six months, so I didn’t want to leave with that image.’ The Bianconeri star was then questioned on the prospect of linking up with fellow countryman and Ballon d’Or holder Lionel Messi at Barcelona. And though Dybala admitted that such a move ‘would be very nice’, he was also quick to reiterate his commitment to Juventus: ‘The truth is that Barcelona is a huge team worldwide and with Messi, they’re even bigger.’ ‘It would be very nice, but Juventus is also an incredible club, very big, full of history, where there are currently great players.’ Ole Gunnar Solskjaer provides latest on Man United squad ahead of Tottenham Chelsea ready a £75m bid for Kai Havertz, Man United also in mix & optimism over N’Golo Kante’s possible return Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
