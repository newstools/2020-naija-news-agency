A police statement has confirmed that Aston Villa standout Jack Grealish has been charged with two offences, after breaking COVID-19 lockdown rules earlier this year. The incident in question came late in March, when Grealish’s name took centre stage across the English media. After speculation began to circulate that the English midfielder had been spotted breaking quarantine restrictions, the finer details soon followed, with it revealed that Grealish’s Range Rover had been involved in a crash. Photos of the Aston Villa star at the scene subsequently emerged online, before it was confirmed that Grealish had been present at a Saturday night house party in Solihull.

A swift public backlash inevitably followed, forcing Aston Villa into taking action against their club captain. In a post across the Claret and Blues’ social media platforms and official website, Villa condemned Grealish’s decision-making, before confirming that the midfielder had been fined: Club Statement.#AVFC — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) March 30, 2020 Grealish himself, at the time, also issued a public apology, confirming that he had been left thoroughly ’embarrassed’ by the incident, as well as revealing his hopes that the public would accept that he had simply made a mistake. Many, though, were understandably not so quick to forgive, amid widespread agreement that individuals in Grealish’s position should be amongst those setting an example during such a difficult moment in time. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1183602906-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 26: Jack Grealish of Aston Villa in action during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium on October 26, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

In a statement released earlier today, it was confirmed that the Villa star has been charged with a pair of offences. These come in the form of ‘driving without due care and attention’ and ‘failing to stop or report a collision’. Grealish’s hearing regarding the matter will be held at Birmingham Magistrates Court on August 25th: ‘A Premier League footballer has been charged with driving without due care and attention, and failing to stop at or report a collision. Jack Grealish is accused of the offences in Waterside, Dickens Heath, Solihull, on Sunday March 29.’ ‘An investigation was launched after we responded to reports of a car hitting parked vehicles and the driver fleeing on foot.
