Former Brazilian international Ronaldo has provided his take on the current top-5 players on the planet, with Lionel Messi inevitably included, but namesake Cristiano Ronaldo somewhat controversially omitted. For the last decade+, fans across the globe have argued at length as to which of football’s two most iconic names can consider himself the world’s best. Ronaldo and Messi have of course defined a generation, with the almost-inconceivable consistency with which the pair have found the net over the course of their respective careers unlikely to ever be matched again. Silverware, both individual and at club level, have also followed, with a staggering 11 Ballon d’Ors (advantage Messi) and 9 Champions League crowns (advantage Ronaldo) shared between the Argentine and Portuguese superstars. Most would argue that it is Messi who is not only the superior talent, but quite possibly the most gifted footballer to ever grace the pitch. Those in favour of Ronaldo, on the other hand, point to the former Real Madrid man’s relentless desire to improve, as well as his almost freak-like athleticism. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-897551828-1024x686.jpg?resize=1024%2C686&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MADRID, SPAIN – DECEMBER 23: Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid greets Lionel Messi of Barcelona prior to the La Liga match between Real Madrid and Barcelona at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on December 23, 2017 in Madrid, Spain.

And, as outlined above, the latest individual to have revealed his opinion that, at least at present, Messi takes the crown, is Brazilian legend and Cristiano Ronaldo namesake Ronaldo Nazario. While the former Real Madrid and Barcelona star’s choice in itself is of course not an overly eye-catching one, however, what is is the fact that Ronaldo does not feel that CR7 currently belongs on the list of the world’s top-5 players. Speaking in an interview with AS over the weekend, Ronaldo was drawn on who he feels represents the pinnacle of talent in the modern game. And, after naming Messi as ‘number one’, the Selecao icon went on to add Mohamed Salah, Eden Hazard, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe to the mix: ‘Messi, of course, he is number one, he is a talent that means it will take 20 or 30 years to see something similar.’ ‘I also like Salah, Hazard, Neymar, I love watching him play, of course Mbappe.’ Leo Messi’s Barcelona free agent exit clause has expired & Man City to complete Nelson Semedo signing.
