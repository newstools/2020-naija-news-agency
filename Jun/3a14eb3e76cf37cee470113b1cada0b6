Barcelona and Juventus have confirmed that midfielders Arthur Melo and Miralem Pjanic have swapped clubs, in a big-money exchange. On the back of the COVID-19 pandemic, finances available to clubs on the transfer market this summer are expected to take a heavy hit. This, in turn, has seen a host of potential swap deals touted in the media, as sides across Europe prepare for the 2020/21 campaign with a slashed budget at their disposal. One high-profile player to have been at the centre of a whole host of rumoured exchange deals, meanwhile, has been Juventus’ Miralem Pjanic. Bosian midfielder Pjanic was once considered an integral cog in the Bianconeri’s ranks in the middle of the park. However, the current campaign has seen the 30-year-old’s performances fall off a cliff, with Pjanic having majorly struggled under new boss Maurizio Sarri. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-943696340-1024x740.jpg?resize=1024%2C740&#038;ssl=1" alt="Miralem Pjanic" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BENEVENTO, ITALY – APRIL 07: Miralem Pjanic of Juventus in action during the serie A match between Benevento Calcio and Juventus at Stadio Ciro Vigorito on April 7, 2018 in Benevento, Italy.

Following links with the likes of Chelsea (for Jorginho) and PSG (for Leandro Paredes), though, one club emerged as a prime candidate to actually push through an exchange. The outfit in question were Barcelona, who, in a bid to secure some much-needed financial gain of their own, offered up the much younger Arthur to Juventus. (The complex financial details involved are explained brilliantly here by the reliable Swiss Ramble.) Negotiations between the European heavyweights were widely rumoured to have moved up a notch over the last couple of weeks, with an agreement being found before June 30th (the end of the financial year) crucial to both sides. As such, it has come as little surprise to see an official announcement forthcoming this evening. In posts across the social media platforms of both clubs, confirmation that Pjanic has joined Barcelona, with Arthur making the move to Juventus, has been forthcoming.
