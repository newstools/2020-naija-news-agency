The 2019/20 Premier League campaign has been a simply outstanding one from a Liverpool perspective. The Reds came agonisingly close to lifting their first-ever Premier League title last term, before being pipped to the post by Manchester City. This season, however, has seen Jurgen Klopp’s men completely blow City away. After 31 games of the campaign, Liverpool sit a staggering 23 points clear of 2nd spot, with just one league loss to their name. The Merseyside powerhouse could also still surpass Man City’s record-breaking 100-point haul from the 2017/18 season. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1188583591-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jurgen Klopp" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 14: Jurgen Klopp the head coach / manager of Liverpool during the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Watford FC at Anfield on December 14, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

Speaking in a recent interview, the Liverpool star claimed that his side being as good in 2020/21 as they have been this term will not be enough to maintain their Premier League crown. The reason for this, according to the Englishman, is that the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United will raise their game. Milner also questioned whether Liverpool will be able to replicate the kind of hunger that they exhibited on the road to glory this season: “This team has shown we can deal with disappointment. We came back from losing the Champions League final and we’ve come back from finishing second with 97 points. Can we now show that we can deal with success? Can we keep showing that hunger and keep playing in the same way? “Being as good next year as we have been this year won’t be enough because City will raise their game and so will Manchester United and other clubs. All these teams are pushing for the top and when you’re right at the very top everyone wants to take it away from you. We are now there to be shot at – and we have to be big enough to deal with that. We have to keep pushing.” Quotes via the Telegraph.
