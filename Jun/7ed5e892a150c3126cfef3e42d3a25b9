She’s ok now. She was arrested and had all her things seized & left in a cell with criminals. D’banj’ team pressured her into those tweets & threatened to leave her in prison if she didn’t recant the allegation. — Dorcas Shola Fapson (@Ms_DSF) June 18, 2020 <img src="https://i1.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dorcas-seyitan-dbanj.jpg?ssl=1" alt="M.I Abaga Has This To Say On D&#039;banj &amp; Seyitan&#039;s Rape Case" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Seyitan The post M.I Abaga Has This To Say On D'banj & Seyitan's Rape Case appeared first on Latest Naija Nigerian Music, Songs & Video – Notjustok.
