"It feels so amazing. It's a dream come true. I just came in the industry two years ago. It means a lot for me. A lot of people supporting me right now. In Nigeria, it's been supporting me even also on my first single, 'Skeleton Move.’ " Master KG Tells Apple Music About His Hometown, Limpopo
"They're so proud. They're so proud. They saw me going around the world winning awards. It was a big thing for the province. Because Limpopo, in terms of the music, we never had that thing of dominating the countries of Africa. But ever since I came and the other guys came, it's been a game-changer. You know? So, we are making them proud." Master KG Tells Apple Music About “Jerusalema" Remix Featuring Burna Boy "It's one of those things which will always be the highlights of my career, making a song with someone like Burna Boy, someone that I look up to. He has done so much for himself. For me to end up getting him on this remix, dream come true. I wanted to do a remix. […] I didn't think of anyone besides Burna Boy because he's one of the best. I love his music and I love how he approaches songs and so forth." Master KG Tells Apple Music About What’s Next
"I'm looking forward to dropping my EP. The support that I've been getting, it means a lot to me. My fans really have been dying hard with me. So, I feel like I owe them something special.” Trevor Stuurman Shares His Proverb of the Week " 'A child that is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.' And this is one of my favorite proverbs because it speaks to what's happening right now in the world; a time where we've allowed the discrimination as well as the injustice to take place for so long, where people are now taking arms and demanding equality and fairness and basically burning everything down in order for them to be heard. Trevor Stuurman Tells Apple Music About Lockdown
"My lockdown has been, geez, it's been a crazy interesting time… It has been a time of much reflection and a once in a lifetime opportunity to be confronted with myself again. […] This has been a great opportunity to reintroduce myself to myself and to remind myself what it means to make it and to learn how to make it again because I feel like what the lockdown came with was that some of our plans were locked down as well. The whole year had to take a different direction. In fact, it had to hit a dead end, so I had to kind of go back to the drawing board and learn how to dream again.” The post Apple Music's 'Africa Now Radio With Cuppy' This Sunday With Master KG appeared first on Latest Naija Nigerian Music, Songs & Video – Notjustok.
