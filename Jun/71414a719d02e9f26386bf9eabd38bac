Updates on Arsenal’s rumoured pursuits of a number of summer targets have been forthcoming online over the last 48 hours. Amid another largely-disappointing campaign to this point, Arsenal are expected to be active on the transfer front upon the reopening of the market over the coming months. After securing just 3 points from a possible 9 since the return of football in England earlier this month, the Gunners sit 9th in the Premier League table. The capital giants were also ousted from the Europa League in heartbreaking fashion by Greek outfit Olympiacos late in February, on the back of a late collapse. As such, another season without Champions League football looms large for Mikel Arteta’s men in 2020/21. The prospect of missing out on a spot in Europe’s top-tier competition once again, meanwhile, has led to inevitable rumours that some of the club’s top talents could be on the move this summer. The key name to have been tipped for an Arsenal exit to this point has been Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who, amid another fruitful campaign in front of goal, has been persistently linked with La Liga champions Barcelona. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1191153156-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s Spanish head coach Mikel Arteta (R) speaks with Arsenal’s Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (L) during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 1, 2020.

As a result, if, as expected, a number of players do eventually depart the Emirates ahead of next season, Mikel Arteta’s paper-thin squad will be stretched to its limits. Such a scenario, though, would no doubt also see a host of new faces arrive in north London over the months to come. One such player to have been persistently touted as a potential addition to the Arsenal cause this summer, meanwhile, has been Thomas Partey. Atletico Madrid star Partey has developed into one of La Liga’s standout midfielders over the last couple of seasons, with Gunners boss Arteta known to be a keen admirer. The presence of a rumoured €50 million release clause in the all-action Atleti star’s contract also makes him one of the more affordable top-class options on the market this summer. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – March 01: Thomas Partey #5 of Atletico Madrid in action during the Espanyol V Atletico Madrid, La Liga regular season match at RCDE Stadium on March 1st 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.

The report, interestingly, comes from the 27-year-old’s home country. According to Ghanasoccernet, the leading football news source in Ghana, Partey’s agents are set to fly to London over the coming days to ‘finalise talks’ over an Emirates switch. The Atletico star appears to have his heart set on a move to the Premier League, with the report adding that he looks ‘destined’ for Arsenal.

If, in the end, the Gunners prove unsuccessful in their pursuit of Partey, however, an alternative target is now said to have been identified. As per ESPN, who cite ‘sources’ close to the situation, Arsenal are also keeping a close eye on the situation of Porto midfielder Danilo Pereira. Experienced Portuguese international Danilo is viewed as a viable fallback option, with the board at the Emirates ‘planning to explore the possibility of a summer move in the coming weeks.’ Though the 28-year-old’s contract contains a €60 million release clause, Porto would reportedly be willing to part with Danilo for around a third of that figure. Elsewhere, updates on Arsenal’s rumoured targets on the attacking front also arrived yesterday afternoon. The players in question come in the form of Willian and Philippe Coutinho. When it comes to the former, John Cross, chief football writer for the Mirror, claims that the Gunners were ready to offer the soon-to-be out-of-contract Chelsea star a whopping £250,000-per-week deal to sign for the club. This, however, was before the COVID-19 outbreak. It now appears unclear whether Arsenal would be willing to finance such a hefty figure to satisfy Willian’s demands, though the influence of super-agent Kia Joorabchian (the Brazilian’s representative) could yet see those in north London swing a deal. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1211165141-1024x730.jpg?resize=1024%2C730&#038;ssl=1" alt="Willian" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 08: Willian of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Everton FC at Stamford Bridge on March 08, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

Though the former Liverpool standout is viewed as something of an outlandish target at Arsenal, it is insisted that the possibility of Coutinho linking up with Mikel Arteta’s squad this summer should not be ruled out. This comes with the struggling Bayern Munich loanee also represented by the aforementioned Joorabchian, who is said to be ‘looking to get’ Coutinho to Arsenal. Any potential deal would obviously come in the form of a loan, though, with the capital giants unlikely to be able to afford Barcelona’s asking price.
