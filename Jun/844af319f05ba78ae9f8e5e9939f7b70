Two games, two wins for Barcelona. After Quique Setien’s side beat Mallorca 4-0 away in their first game back, Barcelona beat Leganes 2-0 at an empty Camp Nou on Tuesday. 17-year-old starlet Ansu Fati broke the deadlock for Barca in the 42nd minute. Leo Messi scored a 69th penalty – his 21st goal of the La Liga season – to wrap up the points. Barcelona are five points clear of Real Madrid at the top of the league, although Real have a game in hand.

El raro festejo de #Messi se hizo viral y en España aseguran que fue en referencia a Colón. Mirá.https://t.co/Ik1XTH9809 pic.twitter.com/Rb6K0tZ3YL — Diario Olé (@DiarioOle) June 16, 2020 There’s an undoubted similarity to Messi’s pose and a statue of Christopher Columbus in Barcelona. So why would Messi care about 16th-century explorer? Ole note: In the city of Barcelona, ​​a debate was opened in recent days around the statue of Christopher Columbus on La Rambla. While some groups are in favor of removing the monument, the mayor, Ada Colau, opposes its removal and said that “it is an icon of the city for better or for worse.” Messi’s celebration has focused attention from his adoring fans as it was new. However, nobody knows what Messi’s message was all about. It feels like those trying to link the goal celebration to Christopher Columbus are hoping to create a narrative which probably fits their political motives rather than the Messi’s.
