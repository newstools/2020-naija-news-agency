In a recent episode of the Ornstein and Chapman podcast (listen below), Athletic reporter Jack Pitt-Brooke, who focuses on Tottenham, offered his insight into how Tottenham may operate in the next transfer window. Bad news Spurs fans: Not much is likely to happen unless the club sells players first. Tottenham have absorbed a huge financial loss because of Covid-19. Spurs had planned to host several major events this year including NFL matches and a Lady Gaga concert, however all those events have now been shelved. It was well documented how Spurs initially furloughed staff in order to cut costs, while the club recently secured a £175m loan from the Bank of England. On that loan, Jack Pitt-Brooke confirmed that none of that money will be used for transfers. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1196976467-1024x672.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 01: Jose Mourinho, Manager of Tottenham Hotspur embraces Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur as he walks off the pitch after picking up an injury during the Premier League match between Southampton FC and Tottenham Hotspur at St Mary’s Stadium on January 01, 2020 in Southampton, United Kingdom. (Photo by Michael Steele/Getty Images) When the Premier League restarts, Tottenham will be able to welcome back captain Harry Kane following injury. Kane’s future has been the subject of speculation in recent months. Now 26, Kane has indicated he may want to leave Spurs. Harry Kane says as much as he loves Spurs he could leave if the club don’t show ambition: ”I love Spurs, I’ll always love Spurs, if I don’t feel we’re going in the right direction, I am not someone who will just stay for the sake of it.”#THFC #COYSpic.twitter.com/1vXPtuMCy7 — Last Word On Spurs (@LastWordOnSpurs) March 29, 2020 However, when asked about the chance Kane leaves Tottenham before the start of next season, the answer is that’s incredibly unlikely. Jack Pitt-Brooke noted: There’s not going to be a market for him. Daniel Levy won’t sell his best player with four years left on his contract unless he’s offered 150 to 200 million pounds. Who in the coronavirus world is going to spend that money? How many clubs can afford Kane? Manchester United, maybe. But they’re after (Jadon) Sancho and (Jack) Grealish). I don’t think Real Madrid are going to do anything. PSG have just bought (Mauro) Icardi. Chelsea have bought (Timo) Werner. And that’s it. That’s the list of clubs who could afford him. On the topic of possible exits from Tottenham, Eric Dier seems close to the exit door as he’s yet to agree a contract extension. Dier is out of contract in 2021. Also, Jack Pitt-Brooke claimed that Tanguy Ndombele is another player available for transfer. Ndombele only joined Tottenham last summer from Lyon for £53.8 million The midfielder agreed a 5-year deal with Spurs. However, Jose Mourinho isn’t a fan of Ndombele. Jack Pitt-Brooke noted: Tanguy Ndombele… Spurs record signing… Spurs’s last Premier League game was against Burnley where Mourinho hammered Ndombele afterwards. It’s fair enough to ask if it makes sense for someone who is so highly-paid and so expensive to be sat on the bench if the manager doesn’t want him. I understand that Barcelona and PSG are both interested in Ndombele. But, once again, I think he might be a victim of the post coronavirus football market: no one is going to stump up 50 million pounds over a player with such question marks. Maybe he’ll go out on loan? Listen to the updates on Man United and Harry Kane, plus Barcelona and Tanguy Ndombele on the audio unit below.
