Speculation across the European media is beginning to mount that Chelsea have taken a firm lead in the race for RB Leipzig star Timo Werner. Versatile attacker Werner has enjoyed a scintillating campaign to date, during which the German has directly contributed to 32 goals in 29 Bundesliga appearances. This includes 4 goals in his last 3 outings, and a a hat-trick two weeks ago, as Leipzig put Mainz to the sword by 5 goals to nil. And there it is!

Watch the Bundesliga live on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 24, 2020 Werner has also found the back of the net on 4 occasions during this season’s Champions League campaign, including a crucial last-16 first-leg strike versus Tottenham. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1207353498-1024x775.jpg?resize=1024%2C775&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 19: Giovani Lo Celso of Tottenham Hotspur and Timo Werner of RB Leipzig during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg match between Tottenham Hotspur and RB Leipzig at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on February 19, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The outfit most persistently touted as a potential destination to this point, though, have been Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp’s electric front-3 of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino is of course widely regarded as one of the finest on the planet, but, behind this trio, the Reds’ attack is severely lacking in depth. As such, Werner, who is capable of lining out anywhere across a trident, is seemingly viewed as the ideal addition to Liverpool’s star-studded squad. Recent reports even went as far as to suggest that Jurgen Klopp held a ‘virtual meeting’ with Leipzig’s star attacker over Easter. As outlined above, though, if the latest word rapidly spreading across the European media is to be believed, then it appears that Liverpool may have counted their chickens when it comes to Werner’s signature. And this assumption now looks set to cost the Reds. According to reliable German outlet SportBild, a new suitor have taken a clear lead in the race for Werner’s services. The outfit in question? Chelsea. It appears that the prolific attacker has grown tired of waiting for Liverpool to make their interest concrete, and has, as a result, ‘decided against’ an Anfield switch. Instead, Werner is said to be closing on a move to Premier League rivals Chelsea, with a big-money contract awaiting the 24-year-old at Stamford Bridge: Werner & Chelsea is getting hot! According to BILD information, Werner should sign a contract with Chelsea until 2025, collecting more than 10 million euros per year — Christian Falk (@cfbayern) June 4, 2020 Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has also weighed in on this evening’s big story, asserting that if Liverpool do not match Chelsea’s bid for Werner over the course of the next few hours, the German international will open contract talks with Frank Lampard’s outfit: Liverpool still haven’t started official talks with Leipzig for Werner, always asked for time. Only talks with the player (via Klöpp). Chelsea are ready with an official bid and if Liverpool will not match it on next hours, Werner will discuss his contract with Chelsea.  #CFC https://t.co/tID7WaOw1A — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 4, 2020 Fresh hope N’Golo Kante will return for Chelsea & Frank Lampard’s problem vs Aston Villa if he doesn’t Tottenham vs Manchester United scheduled for Friday June 19 & when 2019-20 Premier League fixture list will be confirmed Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
