Crystal Palace owner Steve Parish has responded to reports that Liverpool’s Rhian Brewster was the subject of a bid from the club: We have asked Sky to take this downas it is a total fabrication from start to finish. We have not made a bid formal or informal. https://t.co/uIusuAsDcW — Steve Parish (@CEO4TAG) September 21, 2020 The since-deleted tweet from Sky Sports stated that Palace had submitted a formal offer of £19 million plus £6 million in add-ons for Brewster. Furthermore, it was claimed that Liverpool were set to insert a £37 million buy-back clause into any deal struck with the London club. Parish declared that these reports were “total fabrication.” Within football, negotiations with players are kept as secret as possible. Any leakage of information could result in huge differences during talks between clubs. The price or wage demands of a player could even be affected. Brewster may still be of interest to Palace. However, until further information surfaces, at this point, it remains little more than conjecture. The reasoning behind Palace’s supposed interest in Rhian Brewster could come with the sale of Wilfried Zaha in mind. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1182125594-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 19: Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace looks on during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Manchester City at Selhurst Park on October 19, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

A known Gunners fan, Zaha was a long-term target of former coach Unai Emery, with Crystal Palace having rejected offers from their capital rivals last summer. Arsenal of course eventually signed Nicolas Pepe instead. Arsenal’s to do list: Swap Torreira with Partey plus £20m cash adjustment in Atleti’s favour. Negotiate with Lyon and Aulas over £50m Aouar, who wants to come to the Emirates. Gunners squad sales to raise funds. Target Zaha season long loan with option to buy — Layth (@laythy29) September 21, 2020 Arsenal’s attacking options are plentiful. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Willian have started both of the club’s Premier League outings this season. However, Nicolas Pepe, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah are also all still on the Gunners’ books.
