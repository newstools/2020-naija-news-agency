Everton endured a rather quiet start to the 2020 summer transfer window. However, the last week or so has seen the Toffees add a host of new faces to their midfield. First, Everton announced that they had secured Allan’s services last Saturday. James Rodriguez then arrived at Goodison Park less than 72 hours later, with Abdoulaye Doucoure having followed suit on Tuesday. As such, with three new faces now in the door, Carlo Ancelotti has been discussing his goals for the 2020/21 season. And the Italian evidently has rather lofty ambitions for his Everton side, explaining that, on the back of the club’s latest trio of additions, he is hopeful of the Toffees challenging ‘for the first position of the table’: “I wanted a competitive squad and now I have it, so it is absolutely normal that I need to take more responsibility for this and to bring this team to fight for the first position of the table. “I have to be honest, the squad is good in my opinion, we reached the target we had in the transfer window so this puts us under more pressure – but this is absolutely normal and also fair.” Ancelotti added: “We did a fantastic job with these signings. “Honestly, I am satisfied, and I think with it, the goal we want to achieve is to fight for the first position of the Premier League. “It is quite clear we have this ambition to fight and I think we can. “So the target is clear we have to fight for the European position of the Premier League.” Quotes via the Mirror. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1188199071-1024x681.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> NAPLES, ITALY – 2019/12/10: Napoli’s Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti looks on during the UEFA Champions League Group E football match SSC Napoli vs KRC Genk.Napoli won 4-0.

Heading into the matchup, Everton’s recent record against Spurs isn’t exactly great. The Toffees picked up just a solitary point versus the Lilywhites last season, and have actually failed to get one over on Tottenham in any competition since all the way back in 2012. Carlo Ancelotti, though, will no doubt be confident of getting a result on Sunday, after just recently talking up his squad as potential title challengers.
