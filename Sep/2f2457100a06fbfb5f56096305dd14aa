What a time to be African. Africa’s greatest export is its music and OBT’s music is a fusion of all the elements of Africa’s sonic embodiment. Born Adigun Sasmson Adeyinka, OBT’s early musical influences; Lucky Dube, Peter Tosh, and King Sunny Ade are ever-present in his melodic dancehall rhythm which he interpolates with other genres. After studying Music Production in South Africa, OBT returned to Nigeria where he founded ‘95 Issue – a creative media frontier. Under this imprint, OBT earmarked his presence on the music scene with his 2017 release, Killah – a groovy dancehall cut. With the appreciable success Killah garnered, OBT would go on to release a string of singles including his stand-out track, Medasi. An eclectic riddim that cleverly combines elements of Ghana and Nigeria.
