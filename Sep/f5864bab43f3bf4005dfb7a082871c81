Kim Oprah literally brings to mind the phrase “Never to be caught unfresh.” She always comes through with the fire looks and this is not an exception. “A smile is the best accessory you can have ,” she captioned the post on her Instagram page. The reality star and YouTube vlogger is serving us some major looks, and we’re totally here for it. So feel free to pull up these photos when your friends say “show us your rich aunty.” <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119232512_963718754130986_8189439826045194570_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119163531_847508389115529_3280087773544120678_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119201352_174077004198854_787312821540456430_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119163387_1986765008126433_6016934219563543529_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119133761_4391967534177596_8485992629501157907_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119226206_1150849828645175_809670628089997148_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119098628_1013877995684371_2795424159992769129_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/119419043_360791714954094_615038434241911163_n-1.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> Photo credit: @Kimoprah The post We Love the ‘Rich Aunty Vibe’ we’re Getting from Kim Oprah appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
