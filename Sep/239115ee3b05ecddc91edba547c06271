Tottenham are set to return to European action on Thursday evening. Due to Arsenal clinching the 2020 FA Cup, Spurs have to earn their spot in a Europa League group via the qualifying rounds. The Lilywhites have already played one such tie, seeing off Lokomotiv Plovdiv by two goals to one last week. Spurs were clear favourites for that game. But despite putting out a strong eleven, they only scrapped through by the skin of their teeth against the nine-man Bulgarian outfit. As a result, they will no doubt be taking their upcoming Europa League tie very seriously – even though it is against Macedonian side, Shkendija.

(Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) Jose Mourinho would hold his pre-Shkendija press conference on Wednesday. The Portuguese tactician discussed a number of topics in the presser, one of which was Dele Alli. The midfielder has been left out of Spurs’ last two matchday squads, with rumours of interest from PSG in Alli rampant over recent days. However, when speaking about Alli on Wednesday, Mourinho confirmed he would be in the squad to take on Shkendija. “Dele Alli, yes makes the trip, Sergio no, he’s not even in the UEFA list because we knew he wouldn’t be ready to play this match so we kept the same list of the previous round, and Sergio not yet.” Mourinho also voiced the opinion that he sees Alli staying at Tottenham. When asked if Alli will be at Spurs by the end of the transfer window, Mourinho told Sky Sports: “I believe (he will). I can even say that I’m convinced that he will be.” See also: Lincoln City vs Liverpool FC betting tips: Carabao Cup preview, predictions & odds Bayern Munich vs Sevilla betting tips: UEFA Super Cup preview, predictions and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
