Resistance features fast-rising siren Seddy, and in this sensual song, Jess and Seddy explore the repercussions of having an all-in affair where parties involved have no more resistance. This tension follows through into the other songs and develops into a saga where Jess asks his lover to pull him closer. RELATED: Emiboy feat. Teni – I Go Pay He then goes on to declare that he wants more and more, before coming to the suspicion that he might just now be his lover’s puppet. This leads him to go on an odyssey to reassess his views on love. Finally, he comes to the realization that he can achieve balance. Balance consists of 6 songs and features Empawa’s Zarion Uti, and Seddy. The entire EP was produced by Jess, over a period of 10 months, with additional sound engineering done by Doz, additional vocals by 3kene and guitars by ADG. The artwork was done by Suleiman Gwadah “PacMartian” and conveys Jess ETA’s search for Balance. While the EP is an RnB project, the songs are highly influenced by Afrobeats and Afro-soul. <img src="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/listen-on-apple-music/badge/en-US?size=250x83&amp;releaseDate=1599177600&amp;h=24dd0f4cf4646114e7001f45eddc3d88" alt="Listen on Apple Music"/> The post Jess ETA releases new EP, 'Balance' appeared first on Latest Naija Nigerian Music, Songs & Video – Notjustok.
