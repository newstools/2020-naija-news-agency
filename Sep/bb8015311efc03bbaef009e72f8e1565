Speaking on her appointment and the responsibilities ahead of her, Yemi Alade said; “Women are among the 4 billion people who are trying to survive COVID-19 without any form of social protection, and I want to lend my voice to these women and other vulnerable people who make up half of the world that’s struggling to make ends meet. They don’t have the luxury of working from home and are putting their health at risk just to put food on the table.” Speaking further she said; “But as we address poverty and inequality in our COVID-19 recovery plans, we can’t put climate change on the back burner,” Alade said. “Climate change and poverty go hand-in-hand, and neither is gender-neutral. Women in developing countries, such as my homeland Nigeria, are disproportionately affected by both.” Speaking on Yemi Alade’s appointment, UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner, who appointed the Shekere singer said; “We can’t wait to hit the ground running with you, Yemi. We look forward to hearing and sharing the issues that you are passionate about — including women’s empowerment and tackling inequality,” said Steiner as he welcomed Alade to the UNDP family via video. “We at UNDP will also be working to amplify your voice on the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in developing countries and the importance of a green and equitable recovery for all.” This is a huge feat for Yemi Alade who has consistently represented Africa and women right in her music. Yemi Alade is also amongst artistes commissioned by Coca-Cola to celebrate Nigeria on Independence Day and she will also be dropping her 5th studio album very soon. click HERE to know more.
