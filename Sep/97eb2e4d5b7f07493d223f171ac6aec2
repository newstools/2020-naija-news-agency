Inspiration from the iconic 16th-century artist and Renaissance man, Leonardo Da Vinci himself, the LeonardoBySujimoto stands at the very core of sophistication, art, and architecture. Like Blitzkrieg, a holistic warfare game plan that uses the elements of Surprise and Speed in the execution of innovative ideas to achieve the impossible, the LeonardoBySujimoto is coming to disrupt architectural imagination and introduce a new trend with a waterfront property whose features and facilities cannot be found anywhere in Africa. In bringing this project to life, they did not only study the life and history of Leonardo Da Vinci, they studied the best projects in Ikoyi and Eko Atlantic. Armed with this information, they created 7 exclusive features and facilities that give the LeonardoBySujimoto a competitive edge over its counterparts.
