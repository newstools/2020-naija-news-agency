League Cup action returns to our screens once again this week. One of the standout ties of the 4th round pits London rivals Tottenham and Chelsea against one another. You can check out 101’s betting tips for the clash here. Chelsea booked their spot in the 4th round by hammering Championship outfit Barnsley 6-0. Spurs, on the other hand, were handed a bye after their 3rd round meeting with Leyton Orient was called off amid Covid-19 fears. This may suggest that Tottenham hold the advantage heading into Tuesday’s matchup, as they were forced to play one less game. However, due to the Lilywhites’ European commitments, Tuesday’s tie represents just the first of three for Spurs this week – suggesting they are unlikely to depend upon a full-strength squad against the Blues. Jose Mourinho also looks set to be without key man Heung-min Son on Tuesday, after the South Korean suffered a hamstring injury vs Newcastle over the weekend. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1204153984-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LILLE, FRANCE – FEBRUARY 4: Goalkeeper of Stade Rennais Edouard Mendy during the Ligue 1 match between Lille OSC (LOSC) and Stade Rennais (Rennes) at Stade Pierre Mauroy on February 4, 2020 in Villeneuve d’Ascq near Lille, France.

Neither of Christian Pulisic or Hakim Ziyech have featured for Chelsea this term. And, when speaking during his pre-Tottenham press conference on Tuesday, Frank Lampard confirmed that both are still in the recovery stage. On a slightly more positive note, though, Lampard also revealed that both Ben Chilwell, who has been dealing with some injury issues of late, and new signing Edouard Mendy, are fit and in his squad to face Spurs: Frank starts with some team news for tomorrow’s game at Tottenham, reporting that Mendy and Chilwell are fit and in the squad, while Ziyech and Pulisic are still in the recovery stage but not far away.#TOTCHE — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) September 28, 2020 See also: Liverpool vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Liverpool vs Arsenal live streaming: Watch Premier League online, preview, prediction and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
