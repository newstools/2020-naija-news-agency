President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aide, Garba Shehu has said prices of food items in the country is dropping considerably. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/instablog9ja_20200911_36.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024"/>Speaking on Friday, September 11, in an interview with Channels TV, Shedu said, this is as a result of the agricultural reforms of Buhari’s regime. Discussing the recent directive by the president banning Central Bank of Nigeria from releasing forex for food and fertilizer importation, Shedu dismissed claims that the cost of food items was connected to the closure of the borders. According to him, experts who recently surveyed the markets found out that the prices of some food items had reduced. “As of yesterday (Thursday) in the morning of the meeting, go and check the index in markets. For instance in Kano, millets that had gone up to N24,000 has now gone down to N12,000, N13,000. Rice that had been N25,000 is now N20,000. Corn, maize is now N18,000 for the old stock and N14,000, N15,000 for the new stock. So, to say that there is no change in the prices is to show one is completely detached from what is happening in the country,” he said.
