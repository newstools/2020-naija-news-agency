In a statement on Tuesday, Soyinka said that ex-President, Olusegun Obasanjo, was right in his assessment of the situation last week when he first raised the alarm of the country's division under Buhari. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/p0766n0m.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/>Wole Soyinka Soyinka said, “I am notoriously no fan of Olusegun Obasanjo, General, twice former president and co-architect with other past leaders of the crumbling edifice that is still generously called Nigeria. I have no reasons to change my stance on his record. Nonetheless, I embrace the responsibility of calling attention to any accurate reading of this nation from whatever source, as a contraption teetering on the very edge of total collapse. We are close to extinction as a viable comity of peoples, supposedly bound together under an equitable set of protocols of co-habitation, capable of producing its own means of existence, and devoid of a culture of sectarian privilege and will to dominate.

Does anyone deny that it was this president who went to sleep while communities were consistently ravaged by cattle marauders, were raped and displaced in their thousands and turned into beggars all over the landscape? Was it a different president who, on being finally persuaded to visit a scene of carnage, had nothing more authoritative to offer than to advice the traumatised victims to learn to live peacefully with their violators? And what happened to the Police Chief who had defied orders from his Commander-in-Chief to relocate fully to the trouble spot – he came, saw, and bolted, leaving the ‘natives’ to their own devices. Any disciplinary action taken against ‘countryman’? Was it a spokesman for some ghost president who chortled in those early, yet controllable stages of now systematised mayhem, gleefully dismissed the mass burial of victims in Benue State as a “staged show” for international entertainment? Did the other half of the presidential megaphone system not follow up – or was it, precede? – with the wisdom that they, the brutalised citizenry, should learn to bow under the yoke and negotiate, since “only the living” can enjoy the dividends of legal rights?” Politics  News    AddThis  :       Original Author  :   SaharaReporters, New York    Disable advertisements  :Original Article Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka and President Muhammadu Buhari By Nwafor Sunday President Muhammadu Buhari is not in charge of Nigeria, said, Prof Wole Soyinka, Nobel laureate, on Thursday.
