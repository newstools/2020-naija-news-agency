Last night, the highly anticipated tv adaptation of Arese Ugwu‘s 2016 book “The Smart Money Woman” premiered and was received with applause from viewers. “The Smart Money Woman” tackles debt, spending, the consumerist culture of the African middle class, the fear and misconceptions surrounding money and the lack of it. Love, friendships, cultural and societal pressures and the roles they play in success. The 13-episode show stars Osas Ighodaro, Lala Akindoju, Toni Tones, Ebenezer Eno and Ini Dima-Okojie. We’ve put together 10 (group of) tweets that show that viewers had so much fun watching the show and can’t wait for the next episode.
