Leicester’s new season gets underway in less than 24 hours’ time. The Foxes enjoyed a solid 2019/20, but, after something of a collapse over the campaign’s run-in, slipped out of the top-four and down to a 5th place Premier League finish. As such, whilst they probably would have been content with such a finish before the season got underway, Brendan Rodgers’ men, in the end, were no doubt disappointed at the club’s failure to secure a Champions League berth. As a result, they will be eager to start the new term with a bang. Leicester’s first fixture of 2020/21 comes in the form of a trip to newly-promoted West Brom on Sunday. Check out 101’s betting tips for the clash here. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1171361249-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: James Maddison of Leicester City during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Leicester City at Old Trafford on September 14, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

During the presser, the Foxes boss provided updates on a number of his side’s stars. First, Rodgers revealed that new signing Timothy Castagne has ‘fit in very well’, with the Belgian potentially set to feature versus the Baggies: “In the last few days since he joined, he’s fit in very well and I don’t have any hesitation to play him.” Rodgers also went on to provide updates on the fitness of James Maddison, Chrisitan Fuchs, Daniel Amartey, Wes Morgan, Ricardo Pereira and Filip Benkovic, the latter pair of whom are set to miss Sunday’s matchup: “James and Fuchsy have been training this week, so that’s good news. It’ll been brilliant to see them back on the pitch. Dan Amartey has just come back in. “He played 45 minutes of the friendly game last weekend. It’s been nearly two years since his last game, so you always have to be careful when a player’s been out for such a long time, but he’s progressing well. “Wes has rejoined the training group today. We have another 24 hours to asses them all. Ricardo is still a number of weeks away but he’s making good progress. “On Filip, it shouldn’t keep him out for too long, but he certainly won’t be available for this weekend.” CastagneMaddisonFuchsMorganRicardoBenkovićAmartey Brendan Rodgers’ gives a fitness and injury update ahead of #WbaLei — Leicester City (@LCFC) September 11, 2020 See also: Tottenham vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds West Brom vs Leicester betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
