Ikwunado and his apprentices, Victor Ogbonna, Osaze Friday, Ifeanyi Osuji and Ifeanyi Onyekwere were arrested on December 19, 2019 for driving against traffic and tortured at Mile 1 Police Station by one SP Benson Adetuyi. At the point of arrest, the policemen took N93,000 found on Ikwunado and remanded him on allegations of car theft. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/chima-ikwunado-justiceforchima-1200x900.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/> In detention, he alongside others were tortured in the most brutal manner in spite a confirmation by owner of the vehicle that the car was not stolen and that Ikwunado was his mechanic only taking the car for a test-run after routine repair. The late mechanic, who could not bear the pain inflicted on him by the police in detention, died on December 29, 2019, after which his counterparts were charged to court and remanded in January 2020 but were released days later following the directive of the state's Department of Public Prosecutions.
