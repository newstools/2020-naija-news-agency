This follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the state government. According to the President of the Association of Resident Doctors, Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Dr. Mutiu Popoola, the state government after series of meeting with their teams agreed to commit additional resources towards the remuneration of an enhanced salary package for OOUTH medical practitioners with entry-level of CONMESS 3/2 and also agreed to make available Personal Protective Equipments to ensure that health workers are not exposed to any form of hazard.
