Ainsley Maitland-Niles’ future has been part of discussions for a significant period of the window. Initially, it appeared as though Wolverhampton Wanderers would be snapping up the 23-year-old. However, despite this, Mikel Arteta selected the Englishman in the Community Shield victory. The England national team then beckoned and Maitland-Niles recieved a call-up. This gave Arsenal further control during negotiations. Now a senior international player, the versatile midfielder’s value increased. The talk of Wolves went quiet and the season began. Until Wednesday morning that is, when reports emerging from Germany indicated that top-4 rival Manchester United were interested in acquiring Maitland-Niles’ services. Even going as far as to say the paperwork was ‘80% done.’ News from the #PremierLeague: To my information #MUFC wants @MaitlandNiles! Deal and paperwork’s are up to 80 % already. Transfer with the English national should be completed in the next days (€22m + add ons). @ManUtd needs reinforcements. @SPORT1 pic.twitter.com/6fx4TylS2o — Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) September 30, 2020 However, reports from Manchester media said that this information was not true and further sources from both clubs have since denied this. With just days of the window remaining, information around possible departures from Arsenal will be speculated. Arsenal are looking desperately to recoup funds in order to make moves for their top targets. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1036083884-1024x689.jpg?resize=1024%2C689&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Houssem Aouar of Lyon runs with the ball during the Group F match of the UEFA Champions League between Manchester City and Olympique Lyonnais at Etihad Stadium on September 19, 2018 in Manchester, United Kingdom. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images) Arsenal have reportedly had bids rejected for Lyon’s Houssem Aouar. But with a few days remaining of the current window, the Arsenal faithful will no doubt be hoping the Frenchman could still move to the Emirates. Other players who could still leave Arsenal include Sead Kolasinac, Shkodran Mustafi, Sokratis, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi. With the Gunners also believed to be looking at Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey, the club will need to move quickly if they want to complete all the necessary deals before the window closes.
