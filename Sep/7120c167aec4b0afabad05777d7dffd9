Timo Werner joined Chelsea on the 18th of June, departing RB Leipzig. The Blues are understood to have paid around £45m to bring the German to Stamford Bridge. Said deal looked to be a real bargain for the Londoners, given how impressive Werner had been the season prior whilst honing his craft with Leipzig. Across 45 outings in all competitions, Werner chipped in with a staggering 34 goals and 13 assists last term. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea gives his team instructions during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The 24-year-old is yet to get off the mark in England, though he has provided an assist and won a penalty against Liverpool this past weekend. And though no goals have yet been forthcoming, you would still imagine Werner will go on to have a superb stint in south West London. However, Werner has recently admitted that he did have some doubts over a potential Chelsea switch. The reason for said doubts, as explained by the player himself, came because of Chelsea’s comprehensive 3-0 loss at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League back in February. When drawn on said loss by Christian Falk, Werner stated: “I would be lying if I said it wasn’t like that. “The 3-0 home defeat of Chelsea in the first leg against Bayern hadn’t exactly spoken in favour of going to London. “I have to say that openly, because with Leipzig we always played very good and close games against Bayern.” Werner added: “By showing Chelsea the weak points, the club was able to work on the pieces of the puzzle in order to catch up with the future Champions League winners Bayern. That’s what Chelsea did.” Quotes via Goal.
