Frank Lampard has today provided his full backing to Kai Havertz, amid a difficult start to life for the German in southwest London. Gifted starlet Havertz of course came as the latest big-name arrival at Stamford Bridge this summer. Just days after all of Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr put pen-to-paper on terms with Chelsea, the Blues’ staggering recruitment drive kicked up yet another notch. On the back of months of rampant speculation, an agreement was struck with Bayer Leverkusen, to coax Havertz, one of world football’s most highly-regarded young talents, to the English capital. The 21-year-old has committed his future to Chelsea for the next 5 seasons, in a deal worth a rumoured £70 million: He’s here! Welcome to Chelsea, @KaiHavertz29! #HiKai — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) September 4, 2020 Havertz’s arrival, upon its long overdue announcement finally arriving, was understandably met by widespread excitement on the part of Chelsea’s fanbase. To this point, however, the German has not yet managed to showcase his unquestionable talent in the colours of the Pensioners. It is of course very, very early doors when it comes to the 21-year-old’s Stamford Bridge career, but, after struggling to make an impact during his debut outing versus Brighton, Havertz was subsequently hooked at half-time of Chelsea’s defeat to Liverpool at the weekend (albeit only after the Blues were reduced to 10 men). <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: Kai Havertz of Chelsea runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at American Express Community Stadium on September 14, 2020 in Brighton, England.

Speaking in a press conference earlier today, the English tactician assured that, once Havertz returns to full fitness, ‘it’ll become very clear why he’s here’: ‘Kai has played various positions in career, as number nine, number eight and a number 10.’ ‘He played lots off the right for Leverkusen and I have my own vision going forward.’ ‘The key now is getting him fit. Kai, with the situation we are in we aren’t in a position where we can wait. We need to get him fit, and it’ll become very clear why he’s here.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
