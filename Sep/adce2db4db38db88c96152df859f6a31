Alasdair Gold of football.london has, on Wednesday, provided some insight into Tottenham Hotspurs’ transfer plans for the remainder of the current window. Spurs have, of course, already signed a quartet of players during the delayed summer window. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was first through the door with Matt Doherty following shortly after. The Lilywhites were then able to pry Sergio Reguilon and Gareth Bale away from Real Madrid, though the latter has currently only joined on loan. With Spurs having already brought in four players, many may have expected the usually cash-shy Londoners to be done for the window. However, if the latest report from Alasdair Gold is to be believed, then Spurs could well see another few players in the door in the coming weeks. One area Tottenham look to be aiming to strengthen is at centre-back, with Gold reporting on Wednesday that Tottenham have begun talks to sign Inter Milan centre-back Milan Skriniar. The stopper had previously been linked with a move to north London earlier in the window as part of a swap deal involving Tanguy Ndombele. But Gold is now claiming Inter want a fee of around £50m for the Slovakian, a sum Spurs are, unsurprisingly, said to be unwilling to pay. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1224907053-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arkadiusz Milik of SSC Napoli during the Serie A match between SSC Napoli and AS Roma at Stadio San Paolo Naples Italy on 5 July 2020.

As well as the centre-half spot, Spurs also look to be in the market for some attacking reinforcements. As we have previously covered, Tottenham have been linked with all of Callum Wilson, Bast Dost, Andrea Belotti and Napoli’s Arkadiusz Milik in recent months. However, according to Gold, Tottenham’s interest in Milik has now cooled, with Spurs’ links to Wout Weghorst and Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard also believed to be wide of the mark. The very latest state of play with Spurs’ transfer window as the days tick away, including the talks for Milan Skriniar and the many options they’re keeping open as they look for a new striker including Haris Seferovic, plus the players who could leave. https://t.co/suZ5iBA2nI — Alasdair Gold (@AlasdairGold) September 23, 2020 See also: Lincoln City vs Liverpool FC betting tips: Carabao Cup preview, predictions & odds Bayern Munich vs Sevilla betting tips: UEFA Super Cup preview, predictions and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
