<img src="https://i0.wp.com/businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Agboola-Ajayi.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"/> As the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State draws closer, candidate of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Agboola Ajayi, has said that he is the most qualified candidate among his co-contestants to unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress-led government of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu in the state. Ajayi, made the declaration on Saturday at the campaign flag-off of ZLP in Ore, Odigbo Local Government Area of the state. The deputy governor, while reacting to a statement credited to his boss, Akeredolu that he (Agboola) was inexperienced for the seat, declared that, “I am a home-based politician. I am familiar with the challenges of our people. I am the most qualified to be the governor of Ondo state. “The person who said I am a neophyte does not know the meaning of the word. I had served as a councillor, local government chairman, a member of the House of Representatives. “I live among my people and feel what they feel. I am the most qualified to rescue them from the misrule and hardship they have been subjected to by the present administration in the state.” Assuring parents and students that he would review downward tuitions of all state-owned tertiary institutions, Ajayi said the maximum any students would pay is N50,000. He dismissed the N10,000 reduction in tuitions announced by the All Progressives Congress gubernatorial candidate, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu as a ruse, saying he(Akeredolu) was jolted by the promise by ZLP to review downward tuitions of higher institutions owned by the state. The ZLP standard bearer disclosed that if voted into power, his administration would turn around the fortune of civil servants in the state. The deputy governor also disclosed to the people of the state that the N4.3billion state fund discovered in a secret account was allegedly siphoned by the governor’s son, Babajide Akeredolu who collected N433million as consultancy fee even when he had not rendered any service to the state. He, however, assured the people of the state that his administration would abrogate the consultancy system which he alleged was used to siphon the state fund. In his address, a former governor of the state and national leader of ZLP, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko urged the people of the state to collect the money offer by people who planned to buy the votes and still go ahead to vote for ZLP. He described the deputy governor as the most qualified among all 17 candidates participating in the election. Mimiko, therefore, urged the people to go out on the election day to cast their votes for ZLP and wait at the polling booths till they count the votes and announce the results so that those planning to manipulate election results be checkmated.
