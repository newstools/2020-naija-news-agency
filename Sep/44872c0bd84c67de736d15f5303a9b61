In a television broadcast on Wednesday night, Ize-Iyamu said he was ready to work with Obaseki and bring back peace to the state. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Ize-and-obaseki-1024x771.png" data-recalc-dims="1"/>File Photo: Ize-Iyamu and Obaseki. He said, “We are going to talk to everybody. We are going to bring everybody back. I want to salute my brother, the governor. I would like to appeal to him to return to the party. In every family, we have a disagreement. “Let it not be said that it was this disagreement that pushed him out. I made that mistake before and I have come to realise that it was a grievous error and I will not want him as a senior brother to make the same mistake. “I will like to appeal to him to set aside his anger and come back. In APC, he is recognised as a leader and it would be difficult for him to be recognised as a leader in the new party he is going to. “Certainly, we are ready to work with him and all well-meaning Edo people. We believe it is time to bring peace back to Edo State.” Obaseki polled 307,955 votes to defeat Ize-Iyamu, who secured 223,619 ballots in Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The governor was disqualified from contesting the APC primary election after he fell out with a former National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, over the running of Edo State. But Obaseki defected to the PDP where he ran for the election and won.
