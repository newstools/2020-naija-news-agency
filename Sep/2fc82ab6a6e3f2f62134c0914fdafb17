During the presser, the veteran boss was drawn on a number of topics, including Spurs’ recent links to their former star, Gareth Bale. However, Mourinho remained rather coy on the situation, stating: “Gareth Bale is a Real Madrid player. I don’t comment on players from other clubs.” And when asked if he could confirm talks, Mourinho added: “No. That’s not my job to have contacts with agents. Honestly I don’t want to comment on that and again especially regarding players that play for other clubs.” The Portuguese tactician also provided a brief injury update during the presser, confirming that Giovani Lo Celso is back: “Gio is back. Serge had a little knock in training but apart from Tanganga, a few weeks to be back, all good.” Jose on injury news: “Gio is back.
