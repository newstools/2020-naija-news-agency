The latest word stemming from the English press on Monday suggests that Georginio Wijnaldum is set to see out the final year of his Liverpool contract, before departing the club in the summer of 2021. Dutch international Wijnaldum has been on the books of Liverpool since the summer of 2016. And, despite his arrival from Premier League rivals Newcastle having initially gone somewhat under the radar, the 29-year-old has gone on to establish himself as an absolutely integral member of Jurgen Klopp’s midfield over the years since. Wijnaldum has started no less than 27 league games in each of his 4 seasons at Anfield, including all but three of the Reds’ league fixtures en route to English top-flight glory in 2019/20. The Feyenoord youth product’s brace in Liverpool’s stunning Champions League semi-final comeback versus Barcelona last year, meanwhile, saw Wijnaldum etch his name indellibly into club folklore. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1147626567-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – MAY 07: Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal with Trent Alexander-Arnold during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final second leg match between Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield on May 07, 2019 in Liverpool, England.

This comes with the all-action midfielder’s contract at Anfield due to expire next summer, and new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman known to be keen on the services of his fellow countryman: Gini Wijnaldum remains Ronald Koeman’s first choice target for Barcelona but a deal with Liverpool is “complicated”. [@FabrizioRomano] — Anfield Edition (@AnfieldEdition) September 14, 2020 The general assumption had therefore been that, if the terms of a new deal were not agreed upon between club and player, Liverpool would seek out a swift sale, to avoid losing a key member of Jurgen Klopp’s squad for nothing in a year’s time. Thiago’s arrival on Merseyside last week, meanwhile, only appeared to back such a theory. As outlined above, however, if the latest speculation in the media on Monday is to be believed, then Wijnaldum walking out on Liverpool as a free agent now appears not only the most likely scenario, but in fact a near certainty. As per a report from the reliable James Pearce of the Athletic, ‘barring a dramatic change of heart‘, the two parties will go their separate ways next summer. This of course opens the door for any potential suitor (namely Barcelona) to make their move for Wijnaldum in January, when he will be free to discuss pre-contract agreements with other clubs. It seems the Dutchman is soon to be heading for the exit door at Anfield  #LFC https://t.co/FFHBebl9wu — Empire of the Kop (@empireofthekop) September 21, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
