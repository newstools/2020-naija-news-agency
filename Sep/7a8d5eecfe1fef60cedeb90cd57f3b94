The latest reports emerging from France on Wednesday suggest that Arsenal’s under-21 French international Matteo Guendouzi could soon leave the club. According to the above-linked report from Footmercato, Ligue 1 side Marseille have approached Arsenal about a possible loan move for the midfielder. Guendouzi’s situation at Arsenal began to deteriorate after a series of incidents in Arsenal’s 2-1 away loss at Brighton. The second game of the restart post lockdown included the Frenchman appearing to throttle Brighton’s Neal Maupay.

Since then, Guendouzi has not been in the Arsenal match day squad. The Frenchman was apparently refusing to apologise for his actions and this broke the ‘non-negotiables‘ which Arteta had laid out upon his arrival at the back end of last season. Whilst Arsenal are desperate to move players on for financial reasons, a loan deal may suffice for Guendouzi. Whilst the Frenchman was highly thought of, even being recalled and captaining the French under-21 squad despite not playing for his club, a sale appears bleak. Marseille have proposed said loan and discussions are reportedly taking place. 🔴 INFO TELEFOOT [MERCATO] Confirmation de contacts entre l’@OM_Officiel et @Arsenal au sujet de Mattéo #Guendouzi 🤝 Opération très compliquée car #Marseille souhaite un prêt 💶 Alors que les #Gunners veulent vendre l’ancien joueur du @PSG_inside#telefootlachaine #MercatoOM pic.twitter.com/PCBI3sZv9i — TELEFOOT LA CHAINE DU FOOT (@telefoot_chaine) September 30, 2020 Whilst the loan may not be what Arsenal want, it could allow for a more likely sale the following window. The Frenchman’s market value will continue to decrease the longer he remains exiled from the squad, a good season in France could put the Gunners in a much stronger position. There is also the chance of an option or obligatory clause being inserted into any deal.
