Gameweek three of the 2020/21 Premier League season draws to a close on Monday night. The final, and no doubt most anticipated fixture of the day pits Liverpool against Arsenal. With all of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United having already dropped points this season, the early signs suggest that Liverpool could once again run away with the league this term. As such, the aforementioned trio will no doubt be hopeful that Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal can peg the champions back on Monday. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1252295289-1024x656.jpg?resize=1024%2C656&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – JUNE 24: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp looks on prior to the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Crystal Palace at Anfield on June 24, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

Arteta and co. have actually downed Liverpool twice in the last few months. However, neither meeting was at Anfield, with the first having come when the Reds had already secured the league title, and were not playing for much. Arteta, though, appears to be well aware of just how dangerous a fully focused Liverpool side are, explaining: “We know the standards that they have set in this league, how consistent they have been and that is because they dominate almost every aspect of the game. So we need to be at our best, we need to compete really well against this team and hopefully the boys are able to do that on Monday. “There is some variability depending on what they do, how we have to control those aspects, how we can attack in different ways as well. It is like quick waves all the time with them, without much time to breathe. It is a really quick game, it doesn’t see long sequences of passes against them. We have to be at our best, that’s for sure.” With Liverpool and Arsenal also set to face off for a 2nd time later this week in a League Cup clash, meanwhile, Arteta also discussed the difficulties of taking on a rival twice within such a short period: “It is normally difficult enough to play the same team in four days and for the players as well to adapt. Obviously, the first game has a big impact on the second one and it is really tough to beat the same opponent twice in that short period. “When you talk about Liverpool that challenge is much bigger but I just want to focus on Monday. Let’s try to get the best possible preparation against them, go there, and most importantly have the belief that we can go there and win. We all have to believe that we are capable of doing that.” “We know the standards that they have set in this league, how consistent they have been and that is because they dominate almost every aspect of the game. So we need to be at our best.” @m8arteta previews #LIVARS — Arsenal (@Arsenal) September 28, 2020 See also: Liverpool vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Liverpool vs Arsenal live streaming: Watch Premier League online, preview, prediction and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
