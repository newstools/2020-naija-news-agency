In the early hours of Monday, Rema took to his Twitter account to get a lot off his chest— from detractors to the girl who rejected him and inspired the track “Why“, and his first engineer who ran away. The Mavin star boy also thanked Barack Obama for featuring his song, “Iron Man” on his 2019 favourite song playlist and producer, Ozedikus for sticking with him through the tough times.
