Sergio Reguilon has reportedly been at Tottenham Hotspurs’ training ground today to complete his £25 million move from Real Madrid. It appeared as though the Spaniard was on his way to Old Trafford but reports over the last 48 hours have seen the north London club swoop in to snap up the 23-year-old. Spurs were able to do so by conceding part-control back to Real Madrid. As with previous Bernabeu departures, Los Blancos aim to insert buy-back clauses where possible – Reguilon’s totalling just £11 million more than his sale price. Manchester United were unwilling to accept this and so Spurs, willing to accept these terms, moved quickly to hijack the deal. Just in: Sergio Reguilon to Tottenham, here we go soon! The agreement has been reached on last few hours with Real Madrid for €30m as final fee. Reguilon agreed personal terms with Spurs and accepted to join also after talks with #MUFC. Only paperworks to be signed.  #THFC — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) September 16, 2020 Whilst Ben Davies has been a consistent figure at Tottenham since the effective exile of Danny Rose, Mourinho is looking for more attacking bite from his full-backs. Matt Doherty joined from Wolves and immediately displayed his determination to get forward. Reguilon would supersede Davies significantly in this area. Real Madrid have a history of inserting buy-back clauses into the players they sell. The club has done this very successfully to protect the assets they feel have no immediate future at the Bernabeu. Dani Carvajal was sold to Bayer Leverkusen for £4.5 million from their Castilla side in 2012 to be bought back just a year later for £1 million more. The Spanish full-back became the Los Blancos’ first choice and a Spanish international. Alvaro Morata was sold to Juventus for less than £16 million in 2014 before being bought back 2 years later for £7 million more. He won the league title and Champions League before being sold to Chelsea for £58 million. Finally, Brazilian midfielder Casemiro was involved in the strangest of all. Sent on loan to Porto in 2014-15, the Portuguese club activated their €15 million purchase option, only to be gazumped by a buy-back clause. Real had inserted a buy-back clause of just €7.5 million and he quickly returned to the Spanish capital. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-955406444-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Luis Suarez and Sergio Ramos" data-recalc-dims="1"/> Luis Suarez of Barcelona clashes with Sergio Ramos and Casemiro of Real Madrid during the La Liga match between Barcelona and Real Madrid at Camp Nou on May 6, 2018 in Barcelona, Spain.

Only time will tell if he too will return to the Spanish capital.
