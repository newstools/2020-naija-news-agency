Bale left Spurs for a then world record £85m in 2013 and went on to score more than 100 goals and win four Champions Leagues with Real. He originally joined Tottenham as a 17-year-old from Southampton in 2007 for an initial payment of £5m. It is the second new arrival from Madrid to N17 this week, as a £25million deal for left-back Sergio Reguilon has also been completed. Manchester United were interested in both players but unwilling to agree to a buy-back clause for Reguilon and continue to prioritise Jadon Sancho over similar targets. Bale, 31 is understood to have preferred a move back to the club in left in 2013, where he transformed from a left-back to frightening forward and the then world’s most expensive player. Bale won two LaLiga titles, one Copa del Rey, three Uefa Super Cups and three Club World Cups with Real Madrid Bale,  the most expensive British player in history, as well as the top-scoring British player in LaLiga – with 80 goals and 40 assists in 171 league appearances, averaging a goal or assist every 104 minutes. The Wales international made over 200 appearances for Spurs between 2007 and 2013, scoring 55 goals with almost half of those coming in his final season.
