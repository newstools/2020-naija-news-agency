And the Arsenal captain has since admitted that whilst offers from elsewhere were forthcoming, he was convinced to stay by Mikel Arteta: “There were several offers, notably from Barça, but also other clubs,” the 31-year-old said. “My priority was to stay for two reasons: the first is the coach, Mikel Arteta, because we spoke a fair amount during the “lockdown” as they say here, we were at home and spoke several times and he convinced me, notably in terms of the project.” “And of course, secondly, is the love that I receive from the fans and people at the club. Since I have been here I have been treated like one of their own, and as I am one of their own, I am going to stay here, it is as simple as that.” Aubameyang is expected to be handed a start at Anfield on Monday evening, as Arsenal go in search of a major boost to the club’s top-4 hopes. According to the Athletic, Roma made Arsenal aware of their interest in French striker Alexandre Lacazette. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1158262989.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JULY 28: Alexandre Lacazette of Arsenal reacts before going off injured during the Emirates Cup match between Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais at Emirates Stadium on July 28, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by Marc Atkins/Getty Images) The Gunners have a need to sell players if they want to buy. Their midfield priority targets have been Houssem Aouar and Thomas Partey. However, Roma have supposedly been put off by the transfer fee which Arsenal have attached to Lacazette. With only Eddie Nketiah as back up at centre-forward, and Aubameyang generally utilised on the left, the Gunners would require a sizable offer to be convinced of a sale. Liverpool vs Arsenal is set to kick off at 8pm on Monday evening.
