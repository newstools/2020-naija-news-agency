Ruben Loftus-Cheek has had a tough time at Chelsea of late. The midfielder has, of course, had some horrid injury struggles which saw him miss the majority of 2019/20. 2020/21, however, looked to get off to a much more positive start for the midfielder, who was in from the off vs Brighton in Chelsea’s Premier League opener. However, after a rather underwhelming display, RLC was withdrawn after 61 minutes and has not featured for the Londoners since. The Englishman’s lack of minutes has led to speculation that he could be loaned out, with more than eight clubs said to be interested in taking him on loan. Now, Frank Lampard has indeed confirmed that Loftus-Cheek could be loaned out before the current window shuts, though the Chelsea boss did also add that if the right option does not present itself, RLC will stay and be competitive for the Blues: “There is a possibility Ruben might go out [on loan] to play games because I think that would be great for him. “We hold him in very high regard here, I certainly do, and that could be a good option for him. “But if it’s not the right option, he will be competitive in this squad as well because of the qualities he has and hopefully be a big plus for us, so I am relaxed about it. “But I want to find the best path for Ruben and I want to find the best path for us, so at the minute we will see with the week we have got ahead of us.” Quotes via Sky Sports News. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276924735.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WEST BROMWICH, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 26: Thiago Silva of Chelsea looks on during the Premier League match between West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea at The Hawthorns on September 26, 2020 in West Bromwich, England.

The 36-year-old, of course, joined the Londoners on a free transfer over the summer after his PSG contract expired. Silva would be handed his Chelsea debut over the weekend vs West Brom, making a rather high-profile mistake in the process. However, Lampard has since backed the Brazilian to be ‘fantastic’ for Chelsea. And Silva has now spoken about his decision to join Chelsea, labelling them the best in England: “In truth, when I knew it was over with PSG, I always hoped for something big. At first, we were afraid that my age would be a drag and that the leaders would have negative prejudices. It’s very difficult to bounce back when you’re past 33-34. “But I wanted to believe it, I prayed that God would find me a project that lived up to my ambitions. He heard me because Chelsea are the best in England.” Quotes via Goal.
