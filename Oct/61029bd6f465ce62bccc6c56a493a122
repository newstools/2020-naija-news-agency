Leeds United have this evening been rocked by the news that star midfielder Kalvin Phillips is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines. Marcelo Bielsa’s men made their return to action following the international break last night. The Whites welcomed Wolves to Elland Road, for a Premier League clash. Leeds headed into proceedings with spirits high, on the back of 7 points from an available 9 across the club’s last 3 outings. When all was said and done on Monday, however, the Peacocks were brought firmly back down to earth. Despite dominating over lengthy stretches during the 90 minutes, Leeds eventually succumbed to a 1-0 defeat, as Raul Jimenez’s deflected strike 20 minutes from time proved the difference between the sides. As outlined above, however, whilst their result last night obviously proved far from what Leeds would have been hoping for, defeat to Wolves actually came at a much heavier cost than simply a lack of movement up the Premier League table. Marcelo Bielsa and co. were also dealt a major blow on the personnel front. In a statement across the Whites’ social media platforms a short time ago, word was forthcoming that Kalvin Phillips has picked up a shoulder injury. And, though the English international will not require surgery to amend the issue, he is nevertheless expected to spend the next six weeks on the sidelines. Thankfully for Leeds, with another international break coming up next month, six weeks out of action will likely only see Phillips miss 5 of the club’s Premier League fixtures.
