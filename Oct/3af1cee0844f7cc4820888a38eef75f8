Jesse Marsch, manager of Red Bull Salzburg, has hinted that Frank Lampard’s preconceived expectations for Blues star Christian Pulisic were not particularly high. 22-year-old winger Pulisic of course signed for Chelsea in January of last year, before linking up with his new teammates in the summer. And, all told, the former Dortmund man went on to thoroughly impress during his debut season in the Premier League. The weeks following the resumption of English football in June saw Pulisic begin to showcase what he is truly capable of on a consistent basis, with key contributions versus the likes of Manchester City, Aston Villa and Norwich having proven crucial to Chelsea clinching a top-4 berth.

This is not to say, though, that Pulisic’s Premier League experience thus far has proven smooth sailing. There were moments during the early months of his stint in southwest London in which the attacker looked extremely raw, amid concerns that he may not yet be ready to take on the rigours of English football. One individual, meanwhile, who appears to have had such reservations not only following Pulisic’s arrival, but before the 22-year-old had even departed Germany, is Frank Lampard. Speaking earlier today, Jesse Marsch, manager of Red Bull Salzburg and fellow countryman of Pulisic, recalled a conversation held with the Chelsea boss. During this discussion, the impression was given that Lampard was not expecting much from his side’s 2019 arrival, due to the fact that Pulisic is American: ‘The perception in Europe, mostly, is that the American player is willing to run, willing to fight, has good mentality, but technically they’re not very gifted and tactically they’re not very aware and their experiences aren’t very big, Marsch explained to Extratime Radio. But we’re seeing that change. We’re seeing more and more of these players develop themselves.’ ‘Even Frank Lampard, when I spoke to him in preseason a year ago now, I was talking to him about having Christian Pulisic and he was kind of like, ‘Yeah, he’s got a lot to learn so we’ll see how he does’. I said to him, ‘Listen, he was at Dortmund, and they had a high level of tactical thinking, of playing, and he was very successful’.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY – AUGUST 03: Christian Pulisic of FC Chelsea looks on during the pre-season friendly match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and FC Chelsea at Borussia-Park on August 3, 2019 in Moenchengladbach, Germany.

He was in a group with those players, and it’s not just because he was talented but it was because he understood the tactics and understood how to fit in the game and he was developing a real astute way of how to play.’ ‘I could see right away that Frank Lampard’s idea of Christian Pulisic was shaped a lot by the fact that he was American and not that his football education came a lot from what has happened in Germany.’ ‘Since then, I think Lampard has learned that Pulisic is a lot better than he gave him credit for.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
