Victor Font, the early favourite to be named new president of La Liga giants Barcelona, has spoken out over his vision for the club, plans which include the return of Pep Guardiola. The major talking point in the European media on Tuesday of course surrounded the decision of long-standing Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to stand down. 57-year-old Bartomeu had acted as head of the board at the Camp Nou since 2014. Recent years, and months in particular, however, saw the Spaniard heavily targeted by the Blaugrana faithful. Things came to a head this past summer, when, on the back of Lionel Messi’s attempted exit, and subsequent confirmation that the club’s leadership had proved central to his decision, Barca fans flocked to the Camp Nou, to demand Bartomeu’s resignation: Barcelona fans have gathered outside Camp Nou and are chanting “Bartomeu out!” pic.twitter.com/krYQ1Ctz6f — Goal (@goal) August 25, 2020 As such, with pressure mounting, and a vote of no confidence in full motion, ‘Barto’, in the end, was left with little choice but to depart his post. The Spaniard confirmed the news during a press conference on Tuesday evening, with confirmation of the exits of the rest of the club’s board having also been forthcoming: President Josep Maria Bartomeu announces the resignation of the FC Barcelona Board of Directors. pic.twitter.com/Xr9pBoUzHM — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) October 27, 2020 In the aftermath of Bartomeu’s resignation, meanwhile, much of the talk amongst the Blaugrana faithful, and pundits alike, has surrounded what exactly is next for the Catalans. Still one of the undisputed top clubs on the planet, the next to take up the reins as head of the board at the Camp Nou will be tasked with returning Barcelona to their rightful place amongst Europe’s elite. And, as outlined above, one such candidate has today provided an insight into his plans to do just that. The individual in question is Victor Font. Font, as things stand, is viewed as the favourite to be named the new president of the Blaugrana. Speaking in an interview with Sky Sports on Thursday, meanwhile, the Spaniard spoke out over the route he feels the club must take, to ‘replace the best generation the world of football has ever seen’. Central to such plans is finding a way to convince Lionel Messi to extend his contract beyond next summer, with Font of the opinion that bringing back the likes of Xavi Hernandez and, crucially, Pep Guardiola, could go a long way towards doing so: ‘Replacing the best generation the world of football has ever seen, which I believe we have had over the last decade, is a big challenge.’ ‘It is our intention to build a very strong and competitive project and we are very lucky at Barca that we inherited a style of play that Johan Cruyff instilled throughout the organisation.’ ‘And most of the best professionals who know about this style are also fans and love the club – like Pep Guardiola, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol.’ <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1140199232-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1140199232-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1140199232-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1140199232-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – APRIL 03: Josep Guardiola, Manager of Manchester City looks on prior to the Premier League match between Manchester City and Cardiff City at Etihad Stadium on April 03, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.
