Luis Suarez has opened up on the negative emotions he wrestled with towards the end of his time with FC Barcelona. The Uruguayan forward spoke of the troubles which culminated in his move to Atletico Madrid: “Those days were very difficult. I cried because of what I was having to go through.” Suarez was seen very emotional during his farewell press conference. “It is very difficult for me” Luis Suarez did everything he could to hold back the tears in his Barcelona farewell press conference  pic.twitter.com/f0FHPcjBPP — Goal (@goal) September 24, 2020 “I was hurt most of all by the way they did things, because one has to accept it when a cycle comes to an end.” Suarez made Barcelona realise what they had let go by coming on late against Granada in his Atletico Madrid debut, before scoring twice and grabbing an assist in less than 10 minutes. Blaugrana teammate Lionel Messi, meanwhile, was reportedly not happy with the Uruguayan’s exit. Suarez reacted to such news by explaining: “I wasn’t surprised that Messi supported me publicly because I know him too well. He knew the pain I was going through, the feeling that I was being kicked out was what hurt me the most.” “The way they did things was not right and Leo knows how me and my family suffered.” If what Suarez describes regarding his former club is accurate, then it is certainly being reflected in the vote of no confidence facing club president Josep Maria Bartomeu. The vote required just 16,520 signatures, but over 18,000 have been officially verified. Jordi Farre, presidential candidate at the Camp Nou, reacted to the news on Cadena SER radio: He said: “If they came to me with 20,000 signatures, I would not have held out until today. Now they will buy time with other things. They shuffled that the Generalitat would say that the referendum could not be called.” <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-519243208-1024x661.jpg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-519243208-1024x661.jpg?resize=1024%2C661&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-519243208-1024x661.jpg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-519243208-1024x661.jpg?resize=1024%2C661&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – APRIL 05: A club crest is seen prior to the UEFA Champions League quarter final first leg match between FC Barcelona and Club Atletico de Madrid at Camp Nou on April 5, 2016 in Barcelona, Spain.
