Wolves secured the services of Adam Traore from Middlesbrough in the summer of 2018 for a then club-record fee of £18m. Such a fee at the time, given Traore’s previous struggles in the English top-flight, may have seemed a bit much for many. However, the Spaniard, who was previously devoid of any sort of end product to match his blistering pace and quick feet, had begun to improve in the Championship. The La Masia youth had struggled to develop under a number of bosses at Middlesbrough, including Aitor Karanka and Garry Monk. But then, in what seemed like a complete mismatch at the time, Traore actually began to shine under Tony Pulis. The 24-year-old has since continued to develop under the guidance of Nuno Santo, transforming into one of the most feared wingers in the PL. All told, Traore notched four goals and nine assists in the league last term. The Spaniard is yet to register and assist so far in 2020/21, but his ability to terrorise defences has not diminished. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1074553294-1024x657.jpg?resize=1024%2C657&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1074553294-1024x657.jpg?resize=1024%2C657&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1074553294-1024x657.jpg?resize=1024%2C657&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1074553294-1024x657.jpg?resize=1024%2C657&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WOLVERHAMPTON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 21: Adama Traore of Wolverhampton Wanderers during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Liverpool FC at Molineux on December 21, 2018 in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.
