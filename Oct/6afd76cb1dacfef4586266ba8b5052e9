A flat 90 minutes of action between Manchester United and Chelsea this evening eventually saw both sides forced to settle for a share of the spoils. The marquee matchup of the Premier League’s latest round of fixtures took place at Old Trafford a short time ago. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United welcomed Chelsea to Manchester, for a highly-anticipated clash. The two sides headed into proceedings in largely differing form, with Lampard’s misfiring visitors winless in their two outings since the international break. Manchester United, on the other hand, after putting Newcastle to the sword by 4 goals to 1 last weekend, followed up with an impressive win over French champions PSG during the week. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (L) and Chelsea’s English head coach Frank Lampard gesture at the final whistle during the English League Cup fourth round football match between Chelsea and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in London on October 30, 2019.

When all was said and done, however, the hosts toiled in their efforts to do so. An altogether uninspiring 90 minutes of football eventually saw the spoils shared at Old Trafford, a result which does little for either side in terms of league position. Opportunities of note proved few and far between, with Marcus Rashford having seen a very presentable first-half chance well saved by Edouard Mendy. Elsewhere, Christian Pulisic pulled wide from a tight angle, whilst Edinson Cavani rippled the side netting with his first touch in United’s colours after being introduced as a 2nd-half substitute.

All told, though, neither side truly did enough to earn all 3 points, with a draw, on the balance of play, a fair result. 0 – Man Utd have failed to win their opening three home league games to a season for the first time since 1972-73. Blunted. #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/l2pa9nG6XP — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 24, 2020 When it comes to talking points from the 90 minutes in Manchester, it should therefore come as little surprise to find that there weren’t exactly a plethora to choose from. Both managers appeared to set their sides up with the aim of avoiding defeat, rather than chasing a win, tactics which evidently had a telling effect on the action (or lack thereof) this evening. There were, though, nevertheless a couple of impressive individual performances at Old Trafford. Edouard Mendy is the first to spring to mind, with the 28-year-old having produced a trio of solid stops over the course of the 90 minutes. It could of course be argued that Mendy would have been expected to keep out all 3 efforts, but the fact remains that, had Kepa Arrizabalaga been stood between the posts in the visitors’ goal in Manchester, Chelsea could well have been condemned to another concerning defeat following the full-time whistle. Yes, there was one heart in the mouth moment during the first-half when the Senegalese international directed a pass dangerously close to his own net. But, all told, Mendy did what he was asked to do, and looks set to prove an excellent addition to Frank Lampard’s squad. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228868442-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228868442-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228868442-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1228868442-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 03: Edouard Mendy of Chelsea looks on during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on October 3, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

One man, however, who will no doubt depart Old Trafford bitterly disappointed, is Donny van de Beek. The big-money summer addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad was left on the bench for the full 90 minutes, despite United having been in desperate need of a creative spark. Van de Beek was a late introduction during his side’s victory over Newcastle last weekend, and proved a key element in the late flurry of goals which led the Reds to victory. As such, his absence this evening proved concerning. What is it going to take for the Dutchman to gain the trust of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272213735-1024x710.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272213735-1024x710.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272213735-1024x710.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272213735-1024x710.jpg?resize=1024%2C710&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 12: Donny van de Beek of Manchester United in action during a pre-season friendly match between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Villa Park on September 12, 2020 in Birmingham, England.

An incident late in the first-half saw Harry Maguire wrap up Cesar Azpilicueta in the hosts’ box, in a challenge which looked the very definition of a foul: Should Chelsea have been awarded a penalty for this pull from Harry Maguire?
