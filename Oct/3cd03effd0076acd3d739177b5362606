Lucas Torreira’s future appears to have finally been resolved. The Uruguay international is set to link up with compatriot Luis Suarez and Atletico Madrid on loan for the season. Torreira joined Arsenal as one of Unai Emery’s early signings. The Gunners bought the midfielder from Sampdoria for around £26 million. The wait is over… it’s #TimeForTorreira Welcome to Arsenal, @LTorreira34  pic.twitter.com/wnUDYuDMeS — Arsenal (@Arsenal) July 10, 2018 He featured heavily during his initial time at Arsenal, and quickly became a fan favourite. Despite scoring in a North-London Derby victory over Tottenham, Torreira was not known for his forward play. Mainly a defensive-minded midfielder, it was a positional switch under Emery which eventually halted his strong performances. Emery opted to field the Uruguayan in a more advanced role, with Granit Xhaka or Matteo Guendouzi playing behind. Tactically the idea was for Torreira to win the ball higher up the pitch instead of sweeping in front of the back-four. This led to inconsistent performances, before a long-term injury meant that, by the time he returned to action, new coach Mikel Arteta’s combination of Xhaka and Ceballos had already been well established. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209968588-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209968588-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209968588-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209968588-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> PORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND – MARCH 02: Lucas Torreira of Arsenal is treated before he is carried off on a stretcher during the FA Cup Fifth Round match between Portsmouth FC and Arsenal FC at Fratton Park on March 02, 2020 in Portsmouth, England.

Arsenal have long been in need of securing funds to reinvest in transfers, but such funds will seemingly not be raised through Torreira’s departure. The 24-year-old midfielder will join Atletico on a season-long loan with an option (not an obligation) to buy. Atlético and Arsenal have reached an agreement for Lucas Torreira – loan [June 2021] with buy option. No obligation to buy. Medicals scheduled. Personal terms ok.Only when Atléti will sell one player [negotiations for Herrera and Lemar], they’ll be allowed to sign Torreira. — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) October 2, 2020 This is concerning for Arsenal. Torreira cost the club a significant fee, and the Gunners are no doubt keen to avoid too many high-profile losses. The value of the loan fee is yet to be revealed. Whilst this will save Arsenal from paying Torreira’s wages, whether it impacts their ability to compete for the club’s remaining transfer targets is doubtful.
