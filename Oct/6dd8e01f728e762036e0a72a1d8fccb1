This year’s list spotlight 50 writers and producers with scripted series that aired original episodes between September 2019 and September 2020. According to Hollywood Reporter, this year’s list is based on the “relative to slates, deal size, ratings, value to platform and studio, cultural impact and awards.” The list was led by people like Tyler Perry, Issa Rae, Michaela Coel, and a host of others. According to Hollywood Reporter: If there’s a silver lining to this supremely bizarre year, it’s that the appetite for scripted programming endures. From such buzzy breakouts as Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You and Tony McNamara’s The Great to the offerings of prolific uber-creators Tyler Perry and Greg Berlanti, even a pandemic and the recent spate of un-renewals can’t slow the content race. And in its annual survey of TV’s most influential players — those in-demand writer-producers who kept the pipeline full with original episodes over the past 12 months. Scroll below to see some of the writers that made the list: <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117987915_121765262964814_8070174124223810591_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117987915_121765262964814_8070174124223810591_n.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117987915_121765262964814_8070174124223810591_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/117987915_121765262964814_8070174124223810591_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> @Michaelacoelweb Famous British Ghanaian actress, screenwriter, director, producer, and singer Michaela Coel makes this year’s Hollywood reporter Most Powerful TV Showrunners.

Little wonder why he made this year’s list. Holywood Reporter justifies choosing Tyler Perry by stating the following: Having opened his 330-acre Atlanta studio, almost single-handedly launching BET’s ambitious streaming platform (see: Assisted Living, Bruh, House of Payne, The Oval, Ruthless and Sistas ) and accepting the Emmys’ Governors Award all in the past year, Perry remains a singular Hollywood talent — a multihyphenate who knows how to multitask. His last OWN series, The Haves and Have Nots, reigns as a cable behemoth, as his output at ViacomCBS only looks to get bigger. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/81443544_519761201978829_2406040980580228135_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/81443544_519761201978829_2406040980580228135_n.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/81443544_519761201978829_2406040980580228135_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/81443544_519761201978829_2406040980580228135_n.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> @issarae Issa Rae, a multi-talented American actress, writer, and producer.
