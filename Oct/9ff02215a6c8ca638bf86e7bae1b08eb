He lamented unemployment is one of the greatest problems of Nigeria. Senator Oloriegbe said: “The major problem that we have in this country is unemployment; that is why anybody that wants to do empowerment will have to think about what is valuable to the people. “That is why we have empowered no fewer than 85 youth from our constituency on information communications technology (ICT). “We have also provided them with laptops. The other sets of the empowerment involves 125 beneficiaries is in the area of fashion designing, soap making, hairdressing, cobbling and catering. “All these are essentials because all human beings had to eat. The empowerment cuts across all categories of persons.” Oloriegbe, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, urged the youths not to allow themselves to be used for some ulterior motives by politicians. The former World Health Organisation (WHO) consultant spoke with reporters at the sideline of his zonal intervention and empowerment programme in Ilorin, Kwara state capital. “The final thing is to urge people that are sponsoring violence to know that violence does not pay anybody because once a life is lost, it cannot be regained again. “Everybody has a potential but that can only be achieved through peace. Nothing is achieved through violence,” he added.  Original Article
