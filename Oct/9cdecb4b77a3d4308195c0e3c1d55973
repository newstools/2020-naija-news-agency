There’s no reason why Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin can’t become better than Tottenham’s Harry Kane, according to former striker Carlton Cole. The Toffees striker has already scored eight goals in five matches in all competitions, including a hat-trick on Wednesday night in Everton’s 4-1 victory over West Ham in the Carabao Cup. It was his second three-goal haul of the season after bagging another hat-trick in their 5-2 Premier League victory against West Brom. Kane has been leading the line for England in recent years but former West Ham striker Cole reckons Calvert-Lewin could give him a run for his money under Carlo Ancelotti. “He’s the man right now,” Cole told talkSPORT. “We just heard Jose Mourinho saying how he wants Harry Kane to rest [and not play in England’s upcoming games], and he’s the perfect candidate to come in and do the role of Kane. “And he’ll give his own little twist to it as well, I think he’s a really unorthodox striker. “The way he plays is just really industrious, he wants to get on the end of things and I haven’t seen another striker like that, apart from probably Danny Ings. “He’s more of a link-up player, he can assist as well. Remember, he used to play in centre midfield when he was in the youth team, so he’s got that natural gift to be looking for other players for them to score. “He’s really unselfish as well. Harry Kane is really selfish, which you want your striker to be, but I think Calvert-Lewin wants to be more of a team player, not just going out there to get goals.” Asked whether he could become better than Kane, Cole added: “Well, you never know under Ancelotti. Ancelotti is going to get the best out of him.” The post Cole: Calvert-Lewin could become better than ‘selfish’ Kane appeared first on Football365.
