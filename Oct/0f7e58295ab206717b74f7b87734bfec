Chelsea are set to kick off their 2020/21 Champions League campaign in just over 24 hours time. The Blues had a rather disappointing end to their stint in last season’s competition, being hammered 7-1 over two legs by Bayern Munich in the last 16 stage. As a result, this new-look Chelsea squad will no doubt be eager to prove they have improved a great deal since that drubbing.

The Spaniard’s, of course, clinched the Europa League in impressive fashion last term, before holding their own against Bayern in the Super Cup. So, this tie will likely be the Londoner’s hardest match of their group, with their remaining two opponents Rennes and Krasnodar. THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS BACK!!!
