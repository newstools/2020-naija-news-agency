Word stemming from the English media on Tuesday suggests that out of favour Liverpool man Harry Wilson is the subject of interest from as many as four Championship clubs ahead of the domestic transfer deadline. 23-year-old Wilson has been on the books of Liverpool for 15 years, having made his way through the club’s youth ranks. To this point, however, despite being highly-regarded, the versatile midfielder is yet to make a Premier League appearance for the Reds. The last couple of seasons have seen Wilson farmed out on a trio of consecutive loan spells. After impressing with both Hull City and Derby County in the Championship, the Welsh international joined Bournemouth last summer, in a bid to adapt to the rigours of top-flight football. And Wilson, for the most part, subsequently went on to build on his reputation during his time at the Vitality Stadium. Despite having fallen out of favour over the course of Bournemouth’s run-in, he managed to feature in all but 7 of the Cherries’ 38 Premier League outings. Wilson also chipped in with 7 goals, with his free-kick prowess a particular highlight. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1040125510-1024x745.jpg?resize=1024%2C745&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1040125510-1024x745.jpg?resize=1024%2C745&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1040125510-1024x745.jpg?resize=1024%2C745&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1040125510-1024x745.jpg?resize=1024%2C745&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 25: Harry Wilson of Derby County competes for a header with Diogo Dalot of Manchester United during the Carabao Cup Third Round match between Manchester United and Derby County at Old Trafford on September 25, 2018 in Manchester, England.

Bournemouth were of course one of 3 sides to have been sent packing from the Premier League following the conclusion of the 2019/20 campaign. With it also highly unlikely that he would be in line for any sort of consistent game-time at Anfield over the course of the season ahead, though, another Liverpool exit has long been touted for Wilson. To this point, however, a deal has not been forthcoming. With the Premier League’s international deadline having passed last week, meanwhile, Wilson’s chances of securing a 2nd-straight loan to a top-flight club have also come and gone. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1163088864.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1163088864.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1163088864.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1163088864.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SOUTH BEND, IN – JULY 19: Harry Wilson #59 of Liverpool FC controls the ball against Borussia Dortmund in the first half of the pre-season friendly match at Notre Dame Stadium on July 19, 2019 in South Bend, Indiana.

The domestic transfer window in England is of course not set to come to a close until Friday. And, ahead of the fast-approaching deadline, it has today been revealed that as many as 4 clubs from the Championship are expressing an interest in Wilson’s signature. As per John Percy of the Telegraph, the sides in question come in the form of Derby County, Nottingham Forest, Cardiff City and Swansea City, the latter pair of whom would allow Wilson to return to his home country for the season ahead. It now remains to be seen whether any of the aforementioned clubs can push a deal over the line before Friday’s deadline. The 23-year-old himself, though, is no doubt eager to secure a move away from Anfield, at such a crucial point in his development as a player. #lfc winger Harry Wilson is a loan target for a number of Championship clubs before Friday’s deadline. #dcfc – who had him on loan for the 2018/19 season – are keen to re-sign him but face competition from #nffc, #Cardiff and #Norwich.
