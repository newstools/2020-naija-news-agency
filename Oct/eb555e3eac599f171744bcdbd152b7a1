Arsenal’s centre-back situation was exceptionally congested for a side which needed reinforcement. On the roster: David Luiz, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Rob Holding, Sokratis, Shkrodran Mustafi, Calum Chambers and Pablo Mari. By the registration of Premier League players, Arsenal had only two available centre-backs for their Europa League fixture. Gabriel Magalhaes and David Luiz started and played well against Manchester City. But Saliba and Sokratis are not available for selection due to not being registered, Arteta’s options have thinned. The news broke today that Mustafi has been deemed fit to travel with the squad to Austria. This will come as a big boost to Arteta who has massive games against Leicester City and Manchester United on the horizon. An opportunity to rest players is key. See you soon, @skrapid! #UEL pic.twitter.com/U6RdZ7xnrP — Arsenal (@Arsenal) October 21, 2020 Thomas Partey, David Luiz and Alex Runarsson were all seen joining up with the team, where the latter could make his Arsenal debut. What is less positive are some key absences. Dani Ceballos and Willian have been deemed unable to travel due to small injuries picked up against Manchester City. The Spaniard has ‘slight ankle bruising,’ with the Brazilian suffering a ‘slight calf issue.’ The biggest problem for Arteta is Rob Holding. Injured in the warm up in Manchester it has been revealed that he will be out of action for around three weeks. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185920223-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185920223-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185920223-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185920223-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL – NOVEMBER 06: Dani Ceballos of Arsenal FC leaves the field with pain in his leg during the UEFA Europa League group F match between Vitoria Guimaraes and Arsenal FC at Estadio Dom Afonso Henriques on November 06, 2019 in Guimaraes, Portugal.

Spanish centre-half Pablo Mari is aiming to be in full-training within 10 days. Arteta’s defensive issues are certainly lessening. Finally, Gabriel Martinelli, the young Brazilian who burst onto the scene in 2019/20 is looking to return by the end of the calendar year.
