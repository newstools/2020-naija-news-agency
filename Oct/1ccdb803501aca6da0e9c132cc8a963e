Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has urged Mikel Arteta to establish and stick to one system of play, on the back of the club’s defeat to Leicester City on Sunday. Arteta’s men welcomed the Foxes to the Emirates 24 hours ago, for a Premier League clash. Arsenal headed into proceedings no doubt desperate for victory, having managed just 3 points points from an available 9 across the club’s last 3 league outings. In turn, Arteta opted for a new-look 4-3-3, featuring all of Dani Ceballos, Granit Xhaka and summer arrival Thomas Partey. Bukayo Saka and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, meanwhile, flanked lone frontman Alexandre Lacazette. TIME FOR TEAM NEWS @ThomasPartey22 makes first home start @DaniCeballos46 returns from injury @Aubameyang7 back in the starting XI#ARSLEI — Arsenal (@Arsenal) October 25, 2020 When all was said and done in north London, though, to say that the hosts’ XI failed to have the desired effect would be putting it lightly. A toothless performance, completely devoid of creativity, eventually saw the Gunners put to the sword by a goal to nil. The scorer of the evening’s solitary goal came as little surprise, as Jamie Vardy, after being introduced off the bench by Brendan Rodgers, nodded home fellow substitute Cengiz Under’s cross 10 minutes from time. Arsenal’s latest defeat leaves the capital giants languishing in 10th in the Premier League table, with just 9 points from the club’s first 6 outings of the campaign. And, as outlined above, one individual who evidently feels that much of the blame for this poor return lies with Mikel Arteta, is former Gunners stopper Martin Keown. Speaking in the aftermath of his ex-club’s disappointing display on Sunday, Keown was drawn on the main issue that he sees with Arsenal at present. And the 54-year-old went on to pinpoint Arteta’s tinkering, particularly with his system, as one such problem. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229281834-1024x679.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229281834-1024x679.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229281834-1024x679.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229281834-1024x679.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s Spanish manager Mikel Arteta reacts during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Leicester City at the Emirates Stadium in London on October 25, 2020. – Leicester won the match 1-0.

It was like putting an old pair of slippers on for a game. Everything was there. You’d fire it into midfield to Patrick Vieira, into Dennis Bergkamp, [Thierry] Henry into the channel; it was three passes.’ ‘These players now are getting the ball now and it’s jamming a little bit, so I think keep it simple and start building from this team. If this is the way he wants to play, keep with it, and try to put the people in it and get the messages right and work on it.’ ‘It was very static, the front three never really moved from positions, they didn’t make themselves available.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
