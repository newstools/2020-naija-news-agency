Christian Pulisic has today opened up on his pride at being named Chelsea’s new no.10, following just a solitary campaign at the club. 22-year-old winger Pulisic of course signed for Chelsea in January of last year, before linking up with his new teammates in the summer. And, despite his tender years and a couple of rocky patches, the former Dortmund man subsequently went on to thoroughly impress during his debut season in the Premier League. The weeks following the resumption of English football in June saw Pulisic begin to showcase what he is truly capable of on a consistent basis, with key contributions versus the likes of Manchester City, Aston Villa and Norwich having proven crucial to Chelsea clinching a top-4 berth.

Pulisic’s stellar production during his maiden campaign in the blue of Chelsea, meanwhile, came with the attacker having been donning the no.22 jersey. The new season, however, has seen Pulisic take on a new, rather iconic squad number – 10. The number was previously held by Willian, but with the Brazilian having of course since departed Stamford Bridge for capital rivals Arsenal, became vacant over the summer. And, despite a number of high-profile attackers, including the likes of Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech, having linked up with Frank Lampard’s squad over the last couple of months, it was Pulisic who was entrusted with taking on the pressure that comes with the Blues’ 10 shirt. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Christian Pulisic of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images) The latest comments on the part of the American, though, have made abundantly clear the fact that Pulisic himself feels fully prepared to shoulder the added expectation that comes with his new number. Speaking in an interview with CBS Sports this weekend, the 22-year-old was drawn on his decision to take over from Willian as the Londoners’ new 10. And Pulisic went on to reveal that he was in fact the driving force behind the change, explaining: ‘It meant a lot. It’s no secret that it’s been my favourite number. It’s the number I wanted to be.’ ‘Now that Willian moved on this season, there was an opportunity there. I spoke with the club and everyone felt like I was ready for it, and I felt I was ready, and it’s a number I like.’ ‘So it was a really proud moment for me last weekend to wear it for Chelsea for the first time.’ ‘I understand what it means and how much history it has — how many incredible players have worn it before me — but I see it as my favourite number. I just want to do well.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
