Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this afternoon spoke out regarding a number of members of his squad, ahead of the club’s upcoming meeting with Chelsea. The Red Devils are set to return to Premier League action on Saturday evening. Solskjaer’s men will welcome top-4 rivals Chelsea to Old Trafford, for a highly anticipated clash. United will of course head into proceedings with confidence high, having bounced back from the club’s harrowing 6-1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham with a pair of victories since the international break. After first putting Newcastle to the sword by 4 goals to 1 last weekend, the Manchester giants followed up with an impressive 2-1 win over PSG in their Champions League opener on Tuesday night. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s English Forward Marcus Rashford (R) celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Europa League Group H first-leg football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Manchester United at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on October 20, 2020.

The Blues first stumbled to a 3-3 draw with Southampton, before being held once again in their European opener at home to Sevilla on Tuesday. As such, Manchester United will no doubt fancy their chances of securing a positive result tomorrow night. And, as outlined above, ahead of the fast-approaching clash, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this afternoon provided an update on his squad. Speaking in an interview with the Reds’ official website, the Norwegian tactician was drawn on the fitness of those who missed the club’s meeting with PSG during the week. First, Solskjaer confirmed that both Mason Greenwood and Harry Maguire are set to return, though Eric Bailly and Jesse Lingard remain on the sidelines: “We’re still hoping Mason and Harry can be available in the squad. Of course, we have a training session today [Friday], so they’re going to have to go through that. Eric won’t be available. Jesse won’t be available so we’ll manage without them for a few weeks I think.” In what will no doubt come as exciting news for the United faithful, meanwhile, it was also revealed that Edinson Cavani is in line to make his debut versus Chelsea, having of course made the move to Old Trafford as a free agent during the summer: He might be ready for the squad as well for this weekend. He’s been training hard and been training well. I think he’ll be available for the weekend.

Amid the English international’s absence with an unspecified injury problem, claims have spread that Greenwood has been disciplined for poor time-keeping, and turning up to training late on more than one occasion. The United boss, however, has launched a stern defence of his young attacker, insisting that speculation suggesting that Greenwood is anything other than a consummate professional is some way wide of the mark: ‘He made a mistake with England this summer and suddenly all the English press go after him, and that’s something we have to go after.’ ‘He’s a fantastic boy to work with and I have to disappoint you, he’s never, ever late for training and he’s never a problem when he’s at the training ground.’ <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254241562-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254241562-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254241562-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254241562-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JULY 04: Mason Greenwood of Manchester United celebrates after scoring his team’s fourth goal during the Premier League match between Manchester United and AFC Bournemouth at Old Trafford on July 04, 2020 in Manchester, England.

We have photographers outside the training ground every day and they can see he’s on time every day.’ ‘I don’t know where these stories have come from. He’s got a good family behind him, a good background in the academy and he’s a good trainer, he trains really well.’ ‘I cannot believe all these stories about him not being professional, that’s something we have to deal with with many players. Many other players at United have had that.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
