Manchester United reserve goalkeeper Lee Grant has provided an insight into his thoughts on the current shot-stopper situation at the club. Much has of course been made of the battle for supremacy between the posts at Old Trafford over recent months. Spanish international David de Gea once again acted as the Red Devils’ no.1 last season, with Sergio Romero on standby as a highly reliable backup. However, whilst he was once viewed by most as the world’s finest shot-stopper, de Gea’s form has been questionable at best for some time now. This, combined with the fact that Dean Henderson has since returned to Manchester on the back of a 2nd stellar season on loan with Sheffield United, has given rise to something of a dilemma for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Sheffield United’s English goalkeeper Dean Henderson reacts during the English Premier League football match between Sheffield United and Liverpool at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, northern England on September 28, 2019.

Across both of these displays, though, the English international continued to impress, only resulting in calls mounting further for Solskjaer to throw Henderson in at the deep end in the Premier League over the weeks ahead. Whilst it remains to be seen whether the United boss gives in to such pressure, though, as outlined above, another individual with first-hand daily experience of the talents of both de Gea and Henderson has today opened up on the battle for a spot between the sticks at Old Trafford. The individual in question? Lee Grant. Speaking this weekend, the long-time Red Devils reserve goalkeeper was drawn on the selection headache facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. After admitting that he has been impressed by Henderson’s abilities, though, Grant also revealed his opinion that de Gea is currently operating at a ‘really high level’: ‘I have [been impressed], but not just from him (Henderson),’ the former Stoke shot-stopper explained during an interview with United’s official website. ‘Nathan Bishop has been outstanding in training and all the lads will tell you the same. David has come back with a really high level so I’m really pleased for David and how he has started the season as well. The goalkeeping department is in really good shape.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
