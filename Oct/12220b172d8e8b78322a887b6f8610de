The latest international break is now in full swing, with a host of high-profile ties already played out. One of the most interesting matches of Wednesday pitted Spain against Portugal. The tie was just a friendly but watching these two top sides face off is usually a treat regardless of the competition. However, partly due to some solid keeping from Premier League duo Kepa and Rui Patricio, the final whistle blew in Lisbon with the score still at 0-0. Spain must now turn their attention towards the Nations League, with clashes against Switzerland and Ukraine on the horizon over the coming days. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276970062-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276970062-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276970062-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1276970062-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 27: Jose Mourinho, Manager of Tottenham Hotspur reacts during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on September 27, 2020 in London, England.

But with Ukraine and Germany hot on their heels, Spain will no doubt be desperate to pick up six points in the coming days. However, they may have to do so without one of their in-form men. Tottenham new-boy Sergio Reguilon started for La Furia Roja on Wednesday, but was withdrawn at the interval in place of Jose Gaya. No official reason was given at the time, but Spain boss Luis Enrique would confirm after the Portugal game that the doctors will have to assess the full-back: “It is a blow that the doctors have to see. “I hope it doesn’t get complicated.” Quotes via football.london. News of Reguilon’s potential injury comes just days after Argentina confirmed Spurs’ Giovanni Lo Celso is suffering from an injury of his own.
