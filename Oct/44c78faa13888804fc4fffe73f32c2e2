The latest word stemming from the European media this evening suggests that Manchester United are on the verge of signing veteran striker Edinson Cavani. Cavani, 33, is currently a free agent. The Uruguayan of course spent the last 7 seasons plying his trade in France with PSG, during which time he went on to establish himself as one of the club’s greatest-ever players. All told, across just over 300 appearances, Cavani notched 200 goals. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-862868208-1024x704.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-862868208-1024x704.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-862868208-1024x704.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-862868208-1024x704.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRUSSELS, BELGIUM – OCTOBER 18: Edinson Cavani of PSG celebrates scoring his sides second goal with Kylian Mbappe of PSG during the UEFA Champions League group B match between RSC Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium on October 18, 2017 in Brussels, Belgium. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) The 2019/20 campaign, however proved an altogether difficult one for the prolific attacker. Following Mauro Icardi’s arrival from Inter Milan, Cavani dropped down the pecking order at the Parc des Princes, eventually resulting in the South American being afforded starts in just 7 of PSG’s 27 Ligue 1 fixtures, prior to the season’s premature end. As such, with his contract in the French capital having long been due to expire this past summer, it came as little surprise to eventually see club and player come to the mutual decision to part ways. What has come as a surprise, on the other hand, is the fact that Cavani has since not managed to find himself a new club. Despite being available without a transfer fee, no outfit, in Europe or beyond, has agreed to fork over the kind of hefty wage packet reportedly being demanded by the 33-year-old. But, as outlined above, just days before the close of the transfer window, a new suitor appear to have stepped up, and with serious intent. The side in question? Manchester United. As first reported by Rob Dawson of ESPN this afternoon, the Red Devils are ‘actively working’ on Cavani’s signing, after being handed the chance to land the experienced attacker: Man United are in discussions with Edinson Cavani about a move to Old Trafford. Free agent after leaving PSG. Has been offered to every major club in Europe but United now actively working on an agreement. Will probably need to lower wage demands. — Rob Dawson (@RobDawsonESPN) October 3, 2020 And, in a significant update on Saturday evening, it has since been revealed that an agreement between the two parties has been found. As per the reliable Moises Llorens, also of ESPN, Cavani has agreed to the terms of a two-year contract at Old Trafford.
