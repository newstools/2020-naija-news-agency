It’s allowing everyone raise awareness on the violent killings and extortion by SARS and some members of the Nigerian police. Unfortunately, the protest is getting invaded by hoodlums whose intention are not in line with the original aim. There have been reports of vandalism, prison break, theft, injuries, deaths, and so many heartbreaking stories, either from sponsored thugs or rogue protesters. This has made peaceful protests in some states descend into chaos. Despite all the distractions, Nigerians aren’t giving up in the fight. They are staying put, using their voices through social media and fighting against the many injustices in the country. Here’s why these Nigerians aren’t giving up: 1. in case you're getting tired of this #EndSARS movement. Remember these1. People have died for this Cause.2. All we have been doing was just Bluffing.3. The World is watching .4. The government feel vulnerable for the first time in years.5. You may be next. Don't give up!! — Ayo (@AyotheJohn) October 19, 2020 2. Medical Doctors and Lecturers go on strike yearly but Nigerian politicians never go on strike because they enjoy endless benefits. Turning point. Here we are. #EndSARS #ENDBADGOVERNANCE — Dr. Dípò Awójídé (@OgbeniDipo) October 19, 2020 3. I’ve got 2 young daughters. I’ve been planning, leading or joining protests since 2010. I’m protesting in 2020, so my girls won’t have to protest in 2030 or at least, in 2060. I don’t know about others but that’s my “why”. I wholly/fully support #SARSMUSTEND #EndPoliceBrutality — K.O. |  (@KolaOyeneyin) October 12, 2020 4. Quote this tweet with why you are still protesting #EndSARS and calling for Police reforms. I'm still protesting because Ojahb was brutalised & framed for murder he didn't commit. It took Femi Gbajabiamila to free him for what he didn't do. The system failed him. — Elon Mosque (@That_IjebuBadoo) October 18, 2020 5. They celebrate the killing of humans like it's Christmas goats they are slaughtering, they extort money from so many innocent people…I met so many innocent people like me in the cell…I don't know how to start my story… #EndSarsNow — Chocolat (@joelmaiwada) October 10, 2020 6.

The same reason why police do all sorts and get away with it. The people who should bring them to justice are just as corrupt as they are, and they use these people to achieve their goals.
