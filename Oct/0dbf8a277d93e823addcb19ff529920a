Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has provided an update on Alex Telles’ fitness, ahead of the club’s meeting with Newcastle. The Manchester giants are set to return to action tomorrow night, following the recent international break. United face a trip to St. James’ Park, to take on Steve Bruce’s Newcastle. The visitors will of course head into proceedings in search of a bounce-back performance, on the back of an altogether underwhelming start to the campaign. With 3 games played, the Red Devils sit in a lowly 16th in the Premier League table, having managed to secure just 3 points. Their last outing prior to the international break, meanwhile, proved nothing less than embarrassing. A meeting with former boss Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham at Old Trafford eventually saw the hosts downed by 6 goals to 1. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 04: Harry Maguire of Manchester United reacts during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on October 04, 2020 in Manchester, England.

The Magpies have enjoyed a solid start to their own campaign, with summer signing Callum Wilson already proving himself to be an inspired addition. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will therefore no doubt be hopeful of a similar impact from one of the deadline day reinforcements to his squad. Last Monday saw 4 players, in the form of Amad Diallo, Facundo Pellistri, Edinson Cavani and Alex Telles, put pen to paper on terms at Old Trafford. With Diallo still in Italy, Pellistri just 18 and Cavani in self-isolation, though, it will be just Brazilian stopper Telles hoping to make an instant impact on Saturday. And, speaking in his pre-match press conference earlier today, Solskjaer certainly appeared to hint that he is ready to unleash his new left-back at St. James’ Park: ‘Yes, of course he is. I’ll have a word with him today [Friday] and just make sure he feels up to it and, hopefully, we can bring him up to Newcastle.’ The boss is hopeful that Alex Telles can make his United debut on Saturday #MUFC #NEWMUN — Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 16, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
