As we head into the first international break of the season, things really aren’t looking good for Fulham. With four games played of the 2020/21 Premier League season, the newly-promoted outfit are dead bottom of the league. Scott Parker’s side are yet to even pick up a single point this term, losing all four of their outings. And though it is only a small sample size, Fulham do look to have major problems at both ends of the pitch. At the back, Fulham have been leaking goals for fun, conceding 11 goals in their first four ties of the Premier League season. And up top, barring Aleksandar Mitrovic, Fulham have very little attacking threat, showcased by the fact they have scored just three times this term. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1133395605-1024x663.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fulham live streaming" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1133395605-1024x663.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1133395605-1024x663.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fulham live streaming" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1133395605-1024x663.jpg?resize=1024%2C663&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fulham live streaming" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 03: Scott Parker, manager of Fulham during the Premier League match between Fulham FC and Chelsea FC at Craven Cottage on March 03, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.
