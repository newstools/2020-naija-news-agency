Arsenal’s Europa League campaign kicked off on Thursday evening. After clinching the 2020 FA Cup, the Gunners were put straight into the Europa League group stages, despite finishing 8th in the league. Arsenal would be drawn in Group B along with Molde, Dundalk and Rapid Wien. The north Londoners’ first European tie of the season saw them travel to Austria for a clash with the latter of that trio on Thursday. The headline news pre-match surrounded Thomas Partey being handed his first start as a Gunner. However, despite putting on a solid display, Partey could do little to influence Arsenal’s rather lackluster first half. The score at the break was 0-0, with Wien then taking the lead just six minutes into the second 45. To their credit though, after going 1-0 down, Arteta’s side stepped it up a gear with goals from David Luiz and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 70th and 74th minute eventually seeing the Gunners fight back for a key three points.

It was instead the rather questionable display of Bernd Leno. The German was most certainly at fault for Wien’s only goal of the game, with his attempt to play out from the back leading to an easy opener for the Austrian outfit: A costly defensive mistake from Arsenal Bernd Leno loses the ball in his own area and Fountas makes no mistake for Rapid Vienna!

However, a rather worrying stat has since emerged, confirming that apart from Jordan Pickford and David de Gea, Leno has made the most errors leading to goals of any Premier League keeper since the start of 2018/19: 8 – Since the start of the 2018-19 season, only Jordan Pickford (11) and David de Gea (9) have made more errors leading to goals among Premier League goalkeepers in all competitions than Bernd Leno (8).
