Thiago Silva, of course, joined the Londoners on a free transfer over the summer, after his PSG contract expired. Silva was handed his Premier League debut vs West Brom on the 26th of September. During said clash he was guilty of a rather high-profile mistake. However, Frank Lampard backed the Brazilian to be ‘fantastic’ for Chelsea after said error. And Silva then went on to put on a rather commanding display as Chelsea hammered Crystal Palace 4-0 the following weekend. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186500792-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea gives his team instructions during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The duo, who along with Edouard Mendy and Cesar Azpilicueta spoke French during the tie, look to already be forming a decent partnership and could be Chelsea’s main centre-back’s for the campaign ahead. One man who is seemingly of the opinion that Silva is exactly what Chelsea need right now is Zouma. The Frenchman has recently been heaping praise on the 36-year-old, highlighting his clear leadership skills. Zouma went on to state that everyone is very happy Silva chose to make the move to Stamford Bridge before adding he is excited to play with him: “You can see straight away, as soon as he [Thiago Silva] walked through the door at Cobham, he gives advice to the players around him, he’s really good with people and you can definitely see he has very good leadership skills. “Everyone has welcomed Thiago into the group and we are all happy he’s with us at Chelsea. “I’m very excited to work with Thiago but I don’t think I’m the only one, a lot of the guys here at Chelsea feel exactly the same. We are all excited to play with him and to learn from him. “He’s got great experience at the highest level, he’s won a lot of titles and last season he played in the Champions League final. “For me, he’s got everything. He’s calm on the ball, he can defend very well, his positioning is great. I’m very happy he’s here and excited to learn from him.” Quotes via Goal.
