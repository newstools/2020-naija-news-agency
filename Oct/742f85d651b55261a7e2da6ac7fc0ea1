Houssem Aouar, 22, has been on Lyon’s books since 2009. And since breaking into the first-team ranks of the Ligue 1 giants for the first time at the beginning of 2017, the Lyon native has gone on to establish himself as one of the most highly-regarded talents in French football. All told, the youngster has notched 143 appearances across all competitions for Lyon, chipping in with 26 goals and 28 assists along the way. Such impressive displays have seen a host of Europe’s top outfits, including Manchester City, Juventus and Arsenal, linked with the midfielder. The latter of this trio looked to be the most interested party throughout the latest transfer window. But in the end, Arsenal would opt to sign a different midfielder, in the form of Thomas Partey. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-1-1024x699.jpg?resize=1024%2C699&#038;ssl=1" alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 17: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal talks to Thomas Partey of Arsenal before making his debut during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on October 17, 2020 in Manchester, England.

(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images) Partey, despite his limited minutes as a Gunner, does look to have improved Mikel Arteta’s midfield a fair bit, with his defensive prowess and ability to drive play forward something that has been sorely lacking in the north Londoner’s midfield for some time. Despite the positive impact of Partey, though, Arsenal still appear to be interested in Aouar. According to a report from the Daily Mail, citing Italian outlet Tuttosport, the Gunners are still interested in trying to acquire the services of Aouar. However, they will face stiff competition from Juventus. The midfielder himself has also recently commented on him not leaving Lyon over the summer, but he insisted he is happy with the French outfit. “I am happy, this is my city and this my club. “I am proud to represent this club, I have so much motivation to make a great season. “We made a choice, I’m happy to stay here. Aulas and Juninho convinced me to stay in Lyon.” See also: Burnley vs Tottenham Hotspur betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Burnley vs Tottenham Hotspur live streaming: Watch Premier League online, preview, prediction and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
