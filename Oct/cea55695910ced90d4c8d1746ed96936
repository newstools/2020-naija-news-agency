A small protest metamorphosed to a worldwide protest, with a festival of lights to remember those who lost their lives due to the brutality of the Nigerian police and SARS. The youths have shown great support and it’s really commendable. Here’s another proof that our great nation Nigeria is blessed with good people. Over 4.2 million Naira has been raised for Jane Obiene, to get a prosthetic leg after she trekked, walked and joined the #EndSARS protest in Abuja. You might have seen photos of her marching with hundreds of protesters bearing crutches. According to a medical doctor, identified as Aproko Doctor on Twitter, the initiator of the donation campaign for Jane, she had been unemployed since 2013 over her disability among other reasons. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekl05lGXYAAt3b2.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekl05lGXYAAt3b2.jpeg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekl05lGXYAAt3b2.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ekl05lGXYAAt3b2.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> He tweeted: This is Jane.
