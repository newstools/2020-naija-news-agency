And for the most part, it isn’t great news for the Foxes. First up, Rodgers confirmed that Caglar Soyuncu could be out for a number of weeks: “We think that Çağs will most definitely be out with an abductor strain, so we’re waiting on the scan on that. “We think that he is definitely out for a number of weeks, but until we get the final scans, that will determine the length of time.” The Leicester boss also cast some doubt over the potential involvement of Jamie Vardy and Jonny Evans on Sunday, before confirming that Dennis Praet is also a doubt: “Jonny has come back with abdominal pain, so again, we’ll review that. We’re hopeful that Jonny will be okay and that would obviously be a great bonus for the team. “Vards has an issue around his calf, so we’re awaiting a scan on that. “Dennis Praet, obviously, has gone away and done some work with Belgium, so we’ll see how he is, but he’ll be a doubt.” On a slightly more positive note, Rodgers stated that James Maddison will be able to play some part against Villa: “He’s been out with the rehab team and joined in with training so he will be able to play some part at the weekend, which is great news for us.” Fofana could make debutSöyüncü to miss Villa gameInjury news on Praet and MaddisonUpdates on Evans, Morgan and more Brendan Rodgers discussed the fitness of a number of his players ahead of #LeiAvl… — Leicester City (@LCFC) October 16, 2020 See also: Newcastle United vs Manchester United betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Sheffield United vs Fulham betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
