Edouard Mendy has returned to training on Monday, in a potentially huge boost for Chelsea ahead of the club’s meeting with Sevilla. Frank Lampard’s men are set to get their Champions League campaign underway tomorrow night. The Blues will welcome La Liga giants Sevilla to Stamford Bridge, for a highly-anticipated clash. A testing 90 minutes is of course predicted for Chelsea, with Sevilla’s European pedigree common knowledge. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228144692-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228144692-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228144692-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228144692-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Sevilla’s Brazilian defender Diego Carlos (2ndR) celebrates after Inter Milan’s Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku (R) deflected a shot to score an own goal for Sevilla to lead 3-2 during the UEFA Europa League final football match Sevilla v Inter Milan on August 21, 2020 in Cologne, western Germany.

This actually marked the 2nd time in their last 3 Premier League outings that Chelsea conceded on three occasions, following a similar result versus West Brom late last month. The blame for the Blues’ woes at the back is of course widespread, with Lampard’s men, at present, seemingly incapable of defending as a unit. One individual to have been singled out as the club’s biggest problem, though, is Kepa Arrizabalaga. The Spaniard was completely at fault for Southampton’s 2nd of the afternoon on Saturday, just the latest in what feels like a never-ending string of high-profile mistakes. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229125696-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229125696-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229125696-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229125696-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chelsea’s Danish defender Andreas Christensen (2nd R) reacts beside Southampton’s English striker Theo Walcott (R) and Chelsea’s Spanish goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga (2nd L) as Chelsea’s Moroccan midfielder Hakim Ziyech walks past after the English Premier League football match between Chelsea and Southampton at Stamford Bridge in London on October 17, 2020.

This comes in the form of a timely return on the personnel front. Edouard Mendy was of course one of a host of high-profile players to have made the move to Stamford Bridge this summer. After notching a pair of appearances over the early weeks of his stint with the Blues, however, the Senegalese shot-stopper’s integration was delayed by the international break, and a subsequent injury picked up whilst with his country. Mendy was therefore not available to face Southampton at the weekend, and had been expected to spend at least another week on the sidelines. But, as confirmed by the reliable Matt Law, not only is the 28-year-old ahead of schedule in his recovery, but he even managed to train with the rest of Frank Lampard’s squad on Monday. It is therefore not out of the question that Mendy could return between the posts versus Sevilla tomorrow night: Mendy returns to training ahead of schedule for Chelsea to leave Frank Lampard a big (late) call over his goalkeepers for Tuesday night’s Sevilla game #cfc https://t.co/iUI9PJTcqC — Matt Law (@Matt_Law_DT) October 19, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
