Manchester United have this evening released highlights of the club’s latest U23 outing, a 2-1 victory over Everton. The Red Devils’ 2nd-team welcomed the Toffees to Leigh Sports Village on Friday night. The fixture of course came with United having this season returned to the top-tier of English youth football. And, when all was said and done 48 hours ago, the hosts bagged their first 3-point haul of the campaign. United actually fell behind in the clash, when Ellis Simms slotted home on the rebound following a wonderful save from Ondrej Mastny. Neil Wood’s men, though, remained resilient, before levelling things up through Anthony Elanga’s neat near-post finish 20 minutes from time. And the turnaround was complete deep into injury-time, when Ethan Galbraith confidently lashed home from the spot, despite the best efforts of Joao Virginia in the Everton goal. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1281876608-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1281876608-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1281876608-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1281876608-1024x768.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEIGH, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 23: Ethan Galbraith of Manchester United U23s scores their second goal during the Premier League 2 match between Manchester United U23s and Everton U23s at Leigh Sports Village on October 23, 2020 in Leigh, England.

The former proved central in the clash, showcasing once again why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer placed so much trust in his abilities over the course of last season. After doing brilliantly to prevent Everton from doubling their lead with an athletic goal-line clearance, the full-back was also the driving force behind the Red Devils’ late winner, bursting into the visitors’ box, before being unceremoniously upended. When it comes to United summer addition Pellistri, meanwhile, the Uruguayan’s first outing in the colours of his new club proved something of a mixed bag. After taking some time to adapt to the physical requirements of the clash, the 2nd-half saw Pellistri begin to showcase flashes of his potential, with a number of cute touches and intent-filled runs.
