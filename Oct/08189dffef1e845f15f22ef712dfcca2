Brandon Williams burst onto the big stage last season. The Manchester United youth was handed his senior debut vs Rochdale back in September of 2019. The England under-20 international then went on to cement himself as a regular feature in United’s backline. Williams was particularly impressive when operating at left-wing-back in a back-five. However, the back end of 2019/20, with Luke Shaw injured, saw Williams put on some rather questionable displays. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177964270-1024x777.jpg?resize=1024%2C777&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177964270-1024x777.jpg?resize=1024%2C777&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177964270-1024x777.jpg?resize=1024%2C777&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177964270-1024x777.jpg?resize=1024%2C777&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BELGRADE, SERBIA – OCTOBER 24: Brandon Williams of Manchester United during the UEFA Europa League group L match between Partizan and Manchester United at Partizan Stadium on October 24, 2019 in Belgrade, Serbia.

To this point, Luke Shaw has firmly cemented himself above Williams in the Man United left-back pecking order. But with Alex Telles now set to join United, it does appear as though Williams is now the Red Devils’ third-choice at left-back. This, of course, would not exactly be great for the 20-year-old’s development. So, with Telles set to sign, a loan move for Williams would seem like a decent option for the time being. And according to a report from the Manchester Evening News, United have already begun to receive interest from clubs about taking Williams on loan. It is understood that Southampton are among the clubs to have enquired about the possibility of signing Williams on loan. But with Ryan Bertrand still firmly the Saints’ no.1 left-back, would Williams actually benefit from a loan to St Mary’s, as it doesn’t seem like he would be first-choice there either.
