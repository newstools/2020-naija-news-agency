The visuals are out now and it seem the copyrighted owner of the jam is Governor Of Africa. We do not know much about this individual at the moment but they all seemed like they were having fun on this video directed by Mr Layiii. This song is too sweet!!! The ever energetic Davido also appeared on the video to scream " Odogwu say she like to party", a line that originated from this song but also featured on in his "FEM" single in another variation as "Tell Odogwu say we like to party".
