Leicester travelled to Greece on Thursday for a clash with AEK Athens as they looked to continue their fine start to their European campaign. The Foxes picked up a 3-0 victory over Zorya Luhansk last week to go joint-top of their Europa League group. And when Thursday’s EL action was done and dusted, Leicester had managed to maintain a top two spot. Jamie Vardy would fire the Foxes into the lead after 18 minutes, smashing home his penalty. Hamza Choudhury then doubled Leicester’s advantage six minutes before the break. Athens pulled one back four minutes into the second half but it was nothing more than a consolation goal. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1191266686-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1191266686-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1191266686-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1191266686-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEICESTER, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 01: Brendan Rodgers, Manager of Leicester City reacts after the Premier League match between Leicester City and Everton FC at The King Power Stadium on December 01, 2019 in Leicester, United Kingdom.

Said blow comes in the form of an injury to one of their key men. Timothy Castagne has hit the ground running in England following his moves from Atalanta over the summer. In six league outings for Leicester the Belgian had scored one and assisted two. So, his complete omission on Thursday did seem a bit odd. However, it has since been reported that the full-back has a hamstring injury and will be out until after the upcoming international break: Jonny Evans is out with a back problem.
