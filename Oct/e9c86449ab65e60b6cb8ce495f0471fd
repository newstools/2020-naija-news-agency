 A mob comprising hundreds of youths on Sunday morning broke into a large warehouse in Adamawa and carted away food items stored there. A series of videos posted by witnesses first showed the youths advancing towards the warehouse and security operatives forming a cordon over the warehouse and asking them to stay off. The warehouse is located at Kwarnawaya, a community by the Yola-Numan Road near Yola, the state capital. A subsequent video showed the youths, in their hundreds, getting past the security operatives and succeeding in opening gate of the warehouse and helping themselves to available food items.
