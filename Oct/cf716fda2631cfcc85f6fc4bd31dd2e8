Chelsea return to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon. The Blues’ last outing saw them put four past Krasnodar on Wednesday in a Champions League clash. Their league form, though, has been far for impressive of late. In fact, Chelsea have won just two of their six Premier League matches this term, notching three wins and one loss in their remaining ties. Saturday’s tie, however, should prove a fairly routine win for the Londoners. Burnley have a pretty dismal record against the ‘top six’ clubs and have managed to beat Chelsea just once over the last decade. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1269511402.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1269511402.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1269511402.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1269511402.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 29: Hakim Ziyech of Chelsea in action during the pre-season friendly between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at Amex Stadium on August 29, 2020 in Brighton, England.

During the presser Lampard discussed a number of topics, one of which was injury news. Thiago Silva, who has been superb for Chelsea of late, missed the clash with Krasnodar in midweek. However, when drawn on the Brazilian on Thursday, Lampard confirmed that he is fit and was left out of the trip to Russia due to a maintenance issue: “Thiago’s fit, taking him out of the trip to Russia was more of a maintenance issue for him. Kepa has got some progression in his shoulder injury, so we’re hopeful but we’ll see with that one.” Lampard went on to confirm that barring Kepa, Chelsea don’t have any real injury issues: “And in terms of the rest of the squad we don’t have any clear injuries, but it’s a tired group, we arrived back quite late in the early hours of this morning. “So I’ll have to assess everybody, as much tomorrow as today, and see how everyone settles down over the next 24 hours and we’ll see where we’re at.” This would suggest that all of Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Timo Werner and Tammy Abraham are available for Saturday. And this, of course, may give Lampard something of a selection dilemma as trying to fit in all these big names in their best position does seem to be quite a struggle for the Chelsea boss right now. Lampard would be drawn on the challenge of fitting all his attackers in during his pre-Burnley presser and has this to say: “With Hakim Ziyech I thought he was really good last night, when you consider that was his first start for months. He hasn’t been fit so that was a really big plus from the evening. “Not just myself but all the managers who are competing in European football at the moment are finding this a really heavy schedule of games. So we do need options, and in the attacking areas we do have options. “We’re also searching for relationships, because some of the newer players are learning about each other and learning how we want to play. So I’ve got no problem with the options at the minute, and the players have to understand that when you play every three days consistent up until Christmas and beyond, then there will be some rotations at times and we’ll need everybody.” See also: Wolves vs Crystal Palace betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Heart of Midlothian vs Hibernian betting tips: Scottish Cup semi-final preview, predictions and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
