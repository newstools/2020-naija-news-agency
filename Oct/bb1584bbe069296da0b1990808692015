The Champions League is set to return to out screens in less than a week’s time. Bayern Munich would, of course, clinch European glory last term, seeing off PSG in the final. As a result, the French outfit will no doubt be desperate to go one step further this time around. This campaign has seen PSG drawn in Group H along with Manchester United, Istanbul Basaksehir and RB Leipzig – who they beat in the semi-finals last term. PSG’s first group game of the season takes place this coming Tuesday as they welcome Man United to the Parc des Princes. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227657295-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227657295-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227657295-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1227657295-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer leaves after the English Premier League football match between Crystal Palace and Manchester United at Selhurst Park in south London on July 16, 2020. – Manchester United won the game 2-0.

As a result, the Ligue 1 champions would have normally no doubt fancied their chances of picking up three points on Tuesday. However, if Thomas Tuchel’s latest team news update is anything to go by, then PSG could be facing United without a number of regular starters. The German would confirm that all of Thilo Kehrer, Juan Bernat and Mauro Icardi are expected to miss the United game. Meanwhile, Julian Draxler and Marquinhos are also said to be doubts for PSG’s Champions League opener. And though he didn’t state they were injured, Tuchel did hint that both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are somewhat fatigued after the latest international breaks, insisting that PSG need to take responsibility for the pair. Tuchel even went as far as to claim that perhaps PSG may only have 11-13 players available: “We have to take responsibility for Neymar and Kylian, who played almost 90 minutes yesterday, and the South Americans who have travelled a lot. “Maybe we will only have 11, 12 or 13 players available. “We have a bit of bad luck. Draxler and Marquinhos are doubtful for Manchester too. Colin Dagba had a positive [coronavirus test] with the U21s. In the event of a negative test, he can return to the group. “Kehrer is injured for a few weeks. Bernat and Icardi are injured, Icardi, a week ago. It’s the internal ligament in the knee, it’s not too serious but he will miss Nimes and Manchester.” Quotes via Goal.
