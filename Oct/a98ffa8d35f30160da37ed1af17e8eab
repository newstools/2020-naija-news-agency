An insight into Borussia Dortmund’s plans to register 15-year-old sensation Youssoufa Moukoko on the club’s B-list for the Champions League have been forthcoming on Monday. Moukoko is widely regarded as one of the finest young talents in world football. The teen first began to turn heads across Europe after making his debut for Borussia Dortmund’s U17s back in 2017, at the age of 12. Moukoko’s staggering goalscoring exploits, despite his tender years, subsequently saw the German hitman promoted to BVB’s U17 setup two seasons ago. And to say that the teenage hitman has since lit up the German youth scene even further, would be putting it lightly. Incredibly, the 2018/19 campaign saw Moukoko go on to find the back of the net 46 times in 25 appearances, all while playing 3 years above his age group. 46 goals in 25 games … and he’s only 14! pic.twitter.com/45JWdZ2Qvk — Borussia Dortmund (@BlackYellow) June 2, 2019 Before last season was brought to a halt by the COVID-19 outbreak, meanwhile, the prodigious attacker had directly contributed to 43 goals in 20 appearances in the U19 Bundesliga. To reiterate, Moukoko is currently 15 years of age… As such, on the back of a further pair of hat-tricks in his first two appearances of the current campaign, it has come as little surprise to see questions begin to mount surrounding just how early the teenage sensation could be introduced to Dortmund’s first-team setup. If the latest word stemming from the Bundesliga club is anything to go by, though, then the wait could soon be over. Speaking in an interview with Bild (via Goal), BVB sporting director Michael Zorc has confirmed that his side intend to register Moukoko as part of the club’s Champions League B-list squad for the season ahead: ‘Yes, it’s true. We will register Youssoufa for the Champions League via the B-list.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-835449756-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-835449756-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-835449756-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-835449756-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DORTMUND, GERMANY – AUGUST 19: Youssoufa Moukoko of Dortmund smiles prior to the B Juniors Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and FC Viktoria Koeln on August 19, 2017 in Dortmund, Germany.

Dortmund, for one, have already named their squad for the group stages of this season’s Champions League. Moukoko, though, was evidently left out. This only came with the prolific attacker not yet eligible for UEFA senior competition, however. As such, upon his 16th birthday coming to pass next month, Moukoko is set to be named as part of Dortmund’s B-list squad. He will, in turn, qualify as home-grown, and be available for selection to Lucien Favre. This could even see the German youth international go on to make his Champions League debut in the club’s meeting with Club Brugge on November 24th.
