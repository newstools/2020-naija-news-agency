Chelsea manager Frank Lampard this afternoon admitted that ‘there is no definitive answer’ as of yet regarding Callum Hudson-Odoi’s place at the club for the season ahead. The Blues returned to action earlier today, in a Premier League meeting with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea headed into proceedings in search of a statement performance, on the back of a less than ideal start to the campaign. Despite the club’s heavy summer outlay, Lampard’s men had managed wins in just 2 of their first 5 outings of the season. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228790876-1024x675.jpg?resize=1024%2C675&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228790876-1024x675.jpg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228790876-1024x675.jpg?resize=1024%2C675&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228790876-1024x675.jpg?resize=1024%2C675&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho (left) and Chelsea manager Frank Lampard (right) speak to each other on the touchline during the Carabao Cup fourth round match at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London.

Following a dominant first-half display, Chelsea finally took the lead 5 minutes after the interval, when the impressive Ben Chilwell lashed home from close range. Kurt Zouma doubled the advantage 15 minutes later, rising highest to nod Chilwell’s pinpoint delivery from the left beyond Vicente Guaita. And Jorginho added some deserved gloss to the scoreline inside the closing quarter of an hour, stepping up to slot away a pair of penalties, as Chelsea moved up to 4th in the Premier League table. On the back of his side’s first win in 3, meanwhile, Frank Lampard held his post-match press conference a short time ago. The Chelsea boss was drawn on a host of topics, including the display of transfer-linked Callum Hudson-Odoi. The 19-year-old, amid fresh links with German champions Bayern Munich, was handed a start versus Palace, going on to see out all but 7 minutes of the clash. And Lampard, after first praising Hudson-Odoi for his impact this afternoon, went on to suggest that the English international will not be departing the club before Monday’s transfer deadline: Lampard on Hudson-Odoi: “I think Callum’s performance, particularly in the second half when he got more aggressive, he showed ability and pace. Callum is absolutely part of our plans here.” #CFC #CHECRY — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) October 3, 2020 When pressed further on the subject, with a particular emphasis on the interest of Bayern, however, the Blues boss appeared to backtrack, admitting that, as things stand, ‘there is no definitive answer’ regarding Hudson-Odoi’s future: Lampard on Hudson-Odoi and how Hansi Flick said he wanted him at Bayern during the game: “There is no definitive answer, we will know by Monday whether there is. Callum is our player, what Callum wants comes into consideration, it has to work for us.” #CFC #CHECRY — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) October 3, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
