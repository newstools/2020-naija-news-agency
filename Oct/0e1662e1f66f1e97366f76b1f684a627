In his words: This is just the beginning man, it's not about End SARS at this point, it's become a revolution. It's become we want the new Nigeria and soon it will become we want the new Africa. The Grammy Award nominee and self-acclaimed African giant was earlier asked what the global #EndSARS campaign meant to him and young Nigerians. In his words: I mean you have to understand that this is even bigger than Nigeria. You have to understand that Nigeria is the biggest black nation on the face of the earth. I believe that any revolution will start from them. If Nigeria can overcome and can reach it's full potential and the youth can make sure that happens by rising and fighting for their rights like they are doing at this time, then that's going to be like a dominio effect for the rest of the world. That's why it's so important even beyond just us as Nigerians and what we have been suffering for years at the hands of this same set of people.
