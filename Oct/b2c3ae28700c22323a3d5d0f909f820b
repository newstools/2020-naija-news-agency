Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has provided his take on the challenge of opposite number Jordan Pickford, which left Virgil van Dijk with a serious knee injury. Merseyside rivalries were of course renewed a fortnight ago, when Everton welcomed Liverpool to Goodison Park for a Premier League showdown. The clash came as one of the most highly anticipated between the clubs in some time, with the hosts having of course been sitting pretty atop the English top-flight ahead of kick-off. Champions Liverpool, on the other hand, headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, on the back of a shock 7-2 drubbing at the hands of Aston Villa. When all was said and done at Goodison, however, unfortunately, the main talking point did not surround the thrilling, action-packed 90 minutes, which eventually played out into a 2-2 draw. Instead, focus was directed towards a pair of horror challenges, one of which has since resulted in Virgil van Dijk being ruled out for the foreseeable future. Virgil van Dijk will undergo surgery on the knee injury sustained during Saturday’s 2-2 draw at @Everton. Following surgery, Virgil will begin a rehabilitation programme to enable him to reach full fitness as soon as possible. You’ll come back stronger, @VirgilvDijk — Liverpool FC (@LFC) October 18, 2020 The controversial challenges in question came courtesy of Jordan Pickford and Richarlison, with most of the opinion that both Toffees stars, rather than just the latter, should have seen red for their actions: “He could have easily been sent off.” “I’m very surprised it’s just been forgotten about?” Jordan Pickford’s challenge on Virgil van Dijk did not look good Should VAR have stepped in after this? pic.twitter.com/wTcW6CHcIf — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 17, 2020 Pickford has since been heavily criticised, with reports in the media this week having even suggested that the English international has been forced to hire bodyguards, to ensure the safety of his family. And, as outlined above, the latest to have provided his take on Pickford’s widely-discussed ‘tackle’ is teammate and friend of the man whom he left injured, Alisson. Speaking during an interview with Sky Sports this weekend, the Liverpool shot-stopper was drawn on the actions of his opposite number in the Everton goal. And, though he was considerably more levelheaded with his response than a concerning number of Reds supporters have been, Alisson was also quick to criticise Pickford, for an ‘unnecessary moment and movement’: ‘Every goalkeeper has a different way to play, a different way to move, but on that moment 100 per cent it is not a necessary movement.’ <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 17: (THE SUN OUT, THE SUN ON SUNDAY OUT )Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool collides with Everton’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park on October 17, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

Liverpool confirmed earlier today that their star stopper had undergone successful surgery on his injured knee. Jurgen Klopp, speaking during a subsequent press conference, went on to label the update on van Dijk’s wellbeing as ‘the best news you can get’. And, in turn, the reliable David Maddock of the Mirror has gone one better, in suggesting that the Premier League’s best defender could make his comeback before the season’s end: Surgery news on van Dijk huge – means there’s a chance he could play again this season. Klopp says “it was the best news you can get” – and that is significant…means surgery clean & uncomplicated, which is min requirement to cut rehab time from 7+ months, to less than 6.#LFC https://t.co/BXvM4SQp9v — David Maddock (@MaddockMirror) October 30, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
