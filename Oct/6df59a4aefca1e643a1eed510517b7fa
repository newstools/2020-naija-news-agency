Atalanta president president Antonio Percassi has provided a fascinating inside look into Manchester United’s pursuit and eventual signing of youngster Amad Diallo. As was widely documented in the media, transfer deadline day proved rather hectic on the red half of Manchester. On the back of a quiet summer, during which the Red Devils had clinched just a solitary signing, a further 4 players followed suit during the final hours of the window. First up was left-back Alex Telles, who arrived from Porto in a deal worth a reported £15 million. This was followed by confirmation that both youngster Amad Diallo and free agent Edinson Cavani had also committed to terms with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. El Matador has arrived.

Whilst it was understandably the additions of Telles and Cavani which, last week, garnered the most media attention, as the dust has settled, further interest has been piqued regarding United’s pricey Diallo deal. The 18-year-old wide-man had long been viewed as one of the most highly-regarded young talents in Italy, having made his way through the famed youth academy of Atalanta. However, the fact remains that Diallo, to this point, has managed a grand total of 3 senior appearances in his career. As such, when the €40 million figure which the Red Devils are understood to have splashed out on the Ivorian came to light, more than a few heads were turned. This fee, however, did not come on a whim on the part of Ed Woodward and co. In fact, as revealed by Atalanta president Antonio Percassi, it was the culmination of over a year’s worth of scouting and negotiating on the part of the Manchester United board. Speaking as part of an in-depth interview with L’Eco di Bergamo this week, Percassi provided a fascinating insight into the eventual deal which took Diallo to Manchester, going as far as to label the eventual agreement between the clubs a ‘contractual masterpiece: ‘The negotiation with Manchester United lasted almost a year.’ ‘The details and scenarios are crazy. Meeting after meeting we learned unimaginable things.’ ‘This leads to the growth of the club and enriches the work of everyone, from the general manager, Umberto Marino, to the entire staff.’ <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1157006514-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1157006514-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1157006514-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1157006514-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BERGAMO, ITALY – JULY 21: (L-R) Francesco Galuppini of AC Renate, Diallo Amad Traore of Atalanta Bergamo during the Club Friendly match between Atalanta Bergamo v Ac Renate at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d Italia on July 21, 2019 in Bergamo Italy (Photo by Mattia Ozbot/Soccrates/Getty Images) ‘A few days after the Youth League game against Manchester City, the other Manchester contacted us.’ ‘They had followed him, the real negotiation started.
