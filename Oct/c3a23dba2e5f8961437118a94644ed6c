Moise Kean’s time at Everton was less than enjoyable. The 20-year-old failed to nail down a regular starting position at the club. Brought in during Marco Silva’s reign, the Italian was brought on from the bench 23 times during a season which culminated in compatriot Carlo Ancelotti taking over the side. Kean again featured as a substitute at the start of the 2020/21 campaign, the former Juventus youth product realised he would need to move on from the Toffees to continue his development. At 20, failing to get regular minutes can be wildly detrimental to long-term potential being achieved. Speaking to the PSG official website on joining Kean said, “I chose Paris Saint-Germain because it’s a huge club that has won lots of trophies. I feel really important because lots of great players have worn this shirt. I hope I will be worthy of it.” <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194109382-1024x728.jpg?resize=1024%2C728&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194109382-1024x728.jpg?resize=1024%2C728&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194109382-1024x728.jpg?resize=1024%2C728&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194109382-1024x728.jpg?resize=1024%2C728&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Moise Kean of Everton walks off the pitch after being substituted during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Everton FC at Old Trafford on December 15, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

There are some great players at Paris Saint-Germain, who are more experienced than me.” “When I will get my chance to play, I will give my all on the pitch. My ambition is to reach the highest level possible and to give everything for the team.” Since his arrival in PSG, Thomas Tuchel has shown immediate trust in the Moise Kean. The Italian started both games in which he was available for. The 4-0 win against Dijon saw Kean score twice. Mauro Icardi is side-lined with a minor knee injury however the Italian has already matched the Argentine’s goal tally for the season. In the Champions League, Kean did not start against Manchester United in the 2-1 loss but did against Istanbul Basaksehir and scored twice. An initial header from a corner, followed by a good spin and finish to secure the 3 points for the Parisians. Despite the strong form of the Italian, it appears the right decision to leave Everton. The form of Dominic Calvert-Lewin has secured the England international as the Toffees’ starting striker. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209700644-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209700644-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209700644-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1209700644-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – MARCH 01: Dominic Calvert-Lewin of Everton celebrates with teammates after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Everton FC and Manchester United at Goodison Park on March 01, 2020 in Liverpool, United Kingdom. (Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images) Without European football, squad depth and rotation will have not been as necessary in comparison to PSG. Should Everton qualify for Europe next season, Kean’s services may then get further opportunity. Should the Italian continue his fine form in Paris, the capital club may want to make his deal permanent.
