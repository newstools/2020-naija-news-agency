In his words: I have been fighting for over 40 years to be precise, against this system of democratic rule where the Police have the authorization to shoot innocent protesters on the streets. What's happening on the street of Nigeria right now is unacceptable. Every Police office must be held accountable and the government must be held accountable for every life lost. Femi Kuti further explained the duties of the Nigerian Police force to every Nigerian exercising their democratic rights to participate in a peaceful protest. This is a peaceful protest, the Police are meant to protect life and property. The Police are meant to defend the citizens of this country and not kill the citizens. Thank you.
