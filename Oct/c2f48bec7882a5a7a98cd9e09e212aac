Arsenal’s history of Deadline Day insanity is well-documented. The signature of Mesut Ozil in 2013 signalled the moment that the Gunners joined their Premier League rivals as ‘big spenders.’ The impact of the German was immediate, and he helped to end the club’s 9-year trophy drought. And, 7 years later, Arsenal again look set to pull off a Deadline Day madness. Thomas Partey has of course been linked with Mikel Arteta’s men throughout the summer. Until today, however, it had been reported that a deal for the Atletico Madrid midfielder would not be forthcoming. On Monday, though, this has all changed. Reports from a whole host of sources suggest that Arsenal have changed their stance. Throughout the window, the north Londoners had attempted to negotiate with Atleti, in the hopes of reducing the asking price of ~£45 million – the Ghanaian’s release clause. #afc Told Partey personal terms wont be an issue, been provisionally agreed for a while. Medical taking place shortly in Spain. More with @JackRosser_ in blog.https://t.co/3hGutpt6UU — Simon Collings (@sr_collings) October 5, 2020 Atletico were unwilling to do business, with Arsenal having therefore switched focus. Lyon’s Houssem Aouar was then targetted. The 22-year-old Frenchman was the subject of a number of bids, but Lyon President Jean-Michel Aulas eventually confirmed that he would be staying put. Fast-forward mere hours to Deadline Day, and Arsenal have switched targets again, returning to Partey. However, they have decided to bypass negotiations with Atletico, and are reportedly now ready to activate the 27-year-old’s release clause. If Arsenal manage to complete a deal for Partey, it would represent a significant improvement to a midfield lacking in world-class quality. Currently, Arsenal have Granit Xhaka, Dani Ceballos Mohamed Elneny, Joe Willock and Emile Smith-Rowe on their books. Mesut Ozil is also at the club, but appears completely frozen out. Matteo Guendouzi, meanwhile, has departed for Hertha Berlin on loan. Partey’s strengths lie in his ability to progress the ball through the field. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="MADRID - SPAIN: Partey picks up the ball on the edge of the Atletico box and drives forward showing his effectiveness on the ball.

(Source: Wyscout) Arsenal have looked to pass the ball out from the back under Mikel Arteta, which puts the Gunners under immense pressure at times. Partey, though, would offer an alternative route out – Driving the ball forward, finding the gaps and connecting Arsenal’s defensive third to the final third of the pitch. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="MADRID - SPAIN: Having taken the Atleti possession from a defensive area forward, Partey now looks to set up possible attacking situations.
