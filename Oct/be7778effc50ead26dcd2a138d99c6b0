Spurs had a rather productive 2020/21 summer transfer window, landing five senior players in total. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was first through the door, with Matt Doherty having followed shortly after. The Lilywhites were then able to pry Sergio Reguilon and Gareth Bale away from Real Madrid, though the latter has only joined on loan. And most recently, after what felt like an age, Spurs finally brought in a backup for Harry Kane, landing Carlos Vinicius on a season-long loan from Benfica. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1276954703.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1276954703.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1276954703.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1276954703.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 27: Matt Doherty of Tottenham Hotspur runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on September 27, 2020 in London, England.

This was seemingly not due to a lack of effort on the part of the north Londoners, though, with Inter Milan’s, Milan Skriniar heavily linked to Spurs over recent weeks. However, on deadline day, no move was, of course, forthcoming. As a result, Spurs fans probably presumed their hopes of landing a new centre-back were all but over. However, on Tuesday, the Evening Standard have put out a report that suggests otherwise. Though the international deadline has now passed, the domestic transfer window is still currently open until October 16th, meaning Spurs are still able to land players from the EFL. And the Lilywhites look to have already identified one such target in the form of Swansea City stopper, Joe Rodon. Rodon is a product of Swansea’s youth system and has been a fairly regular feature for the Welsh outfit over the last few seasons. And the ES are now reporting that Spurs are pursuing a deal for the Welshman, who they are believed to value at around £7m. Swansea are said to value Rodon, who is contracted to them until 2022, slightly higher at around £18m. However, despite the clear gap in valuation, Spurs are understood to remain hopeful of reaching a deal for Rodon before the close of the domestic window.
