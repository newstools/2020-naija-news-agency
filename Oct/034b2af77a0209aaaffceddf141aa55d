Luis Suarez has this weekend provided an insight into his feelings regarding former club Barcelona. The story surrounding the future of veteran hitman Suarez of course proved one of the talking points of the summer transfer window. On the back of Ronald Koeman’s arrival in Catalunya, word quickly began to do the rounds in the media that the Uruguayan international had been deemed surplus to requirements. In turn, a whole host of potential destinations were touted, with Serie A champions Juventus having long been viewed as favourites to land Suarez. In the end, however, the Bianconeri opted for Alvaro Morata, a move which, coincidentally, opened up the necessary room in Atletico Madrid’s frontline for Suarez. And the Rojiblancos wasted little time in snatching up the former Liverpool man, with Suarez’s swift move to the Spanish capital having been confirmed late last month: #SuárezRojiblanco . . . @LuisSuarez9 has signed his contract and is officially a Red & White player ! #AúpaAtleti pic.twitter.com/E3susK5spa — Atlético de Madrid (@atletienglish) September 25, 2020 Atletico’s gain, however, is evidently Barcelona’s loss. Whilst Suarez is no longer the player he once was, the tenacious attacker nevertheless managed to directly contribute to 33 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions last season. Such exploits saw the Uruguayan move into 3rd-place on Barcelona’s all-time goalscoring list, a stunning achievement when considering he spent just 6 years at the club. Despite the indelible mark left by Suarez in the history books at the Camp Nou, however, the general consensus is that the manner in which the Blaugrana went about pushing him out the door was nothing short of classless. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-913160798-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barcelona Suarez" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-913160798-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-913160798-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barcelona Suarez" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-913160798-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Barcelona Suarez" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – FEBRUARY 01: Luis Suarez of FC Barcelona celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg match between FC Barcelona and Valencia CF at Camp Nou on February 1, 2018 in Barcelona, Spain.

Speaking whilst on international duty this weekend, the striker was drawn on whether he has mulled over what his actions may entail if he manages to find the net against Barca down the line. Atleti are due to face off with the Catalans for the first time this season on November 22nd. And Suarez has admitted that, whilst he would not celebrate as normal due to his respect for his ex employers, he nevertheless intends to make his feelings crystal clear to ‘those responsible’ for his Camp Nou exit (presumably Josep Maria Bartomeu): ‘I will not shout “goal” but I will point to those responsible. I spent six years there and felt I had earned respect.’ Suarez continued: ‘I deserved to know my fate before I found out from the press. Also the coach Ronald Koeman came to me saying that he doesn’t count on me.’ ‘But that was after the leadership of the club had already said there was going to be a change of players.’ ‘That raises doubts about whether it was the coach’s decision or a directive from above.’ Quotes via the Mirror Lionel Messi reached a staggering career milestone in Argentina’s win over Ecuador Man City official sparks hope club could sign Messi next summer: ‘I think we have the financial strength’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
