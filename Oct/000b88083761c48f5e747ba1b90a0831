The latest word stemming from the media on Tuesday suggests that Manchester United are no longer viewed as the frontrunners to land Jadon Sancho. The story surrounding the future of Borussia Dortmund star Sancho of course proved one of the talking points of the summer window. On the back of another scintillating campaign at Signal Iduna Park, during which he racked up an eye-watering 20 goals and 20 assists, widespread reports hinted at a potential Premier League return for the 20-year-old. The likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and even former club Manchester City were all tipped as possible landing spots, though it was of course Manchester United who were most heavily linked. The Red Devils were known to be on the lookout for reinforcements out wide, with Sancho having been identified as the club’s first-choice target. A number of reliable sources even went as far as to suggest that an agreement on the personal terms of a contract had long been found between the parties. Evidently, however, upon last night’s transfer deadline coming and passing, Sancho remained a Dortmund player, as the United board failed to reach an agreement with their Bundesliga counterparts. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227994950-1024x753.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227994950-1024x753.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227994950-1024x753.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227994950-1024x753.jpg?resize=1024%2C753&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BAD RAGAZ, SWITZERLAND – AUGUST 10: Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund during a training session as part of the training camp on August 10, 2020 in Bad Ragaz, Switzerland.

The general assumption on the back of the transfer window coming to a close has been that United will simply reignite their pursuit of Sancho next summer. Such a route, however, now looks far from straightforward. As per Miguel Delaney of the Independent, the Red Devils are no longer viewed as the favourites to land Sancho. With United having failed to take advantage of the pandemic-hit market, both Bayern Munich and, crucially, Liverpool are now viewed as more likely landing spots for the winger next summer. This comes ‘according to figures close to’ the player himself. United’s free run at Sancho is now gone, and many feel he may prefer a move to Liverpool next summerhttps://t.co/YEHVAIhXYt — Miguel Delaney (@MiguelDelaney) October 6, 2020 Interestingly, the Independent’s report comes within hours of similar claims on the part of The Athletic. As per Laurie Whitwell, David Ornstein and more, Manchester United in fact ‘never got close’ to signing Sancho, having not taken Borussia Dortmund’s demands seriously. In turn, the 20-year-old has been left feeling ‘undervalued’ by the Reds, with a move elsewhere looking more likely as a result. ‘Did not take #BVB‘s price & Aug deadline seriously’ BVB Chief Exec called #MUFC at start of summer to lay out terms #MUFC feel total package too expensive Sancho feels undervalued by approach & may now move elsewhere @lauriewhitwell @David_Ornstein @honigstein — The Athletic UK (@TheAthleticUK) October 6, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
