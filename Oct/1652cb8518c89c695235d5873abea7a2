He went further to express that his greatest concern about the EndSARS movement is that SARS will end now as it allegedly has several times in the past and will morph into a different entity down the line with a different form or a different title. Burna Boy applauded the protesters and highlighted that he created a sub-fund under his charity, amongst other things.
