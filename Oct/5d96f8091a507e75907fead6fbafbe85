An update on the Chelsea squad set to take on Krasdonar on Wednesday has been forthcoming online this evening. Frank Lampard’s men are set to get their European campaign back underway in 24 hours’ time. The Blues will make the trip to Russia, for a Champions League meeting with Krasnodar. The Group E table remains deadlocked following last week’s opening round of fixtures, with all 4 clubs sitting on a point apiece. Chelsea’s first European outing of the season saw the Premier League giants welcome Europa League holders Sevilla to Stamford Bridge, with a tense affair having eventually played out into a 0-0 stalemate. The Londoners were since held to another draw at Old Trafford over the weekend, the club’s 3rd-straight across all competitions. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229258996-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chelsea’s French goalkeeper Edouard Mendy plays during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on October 24, 2020.

And, ahead of his side’s meeting with Krasnodar, the Chelsea boss this evening held a pre-match press conference. The main talking point of the presser surrounded the Blues’ team news, with heavy rotation widely predicted. Amongst those certain to miss out in Russia, meanwhile, are Thiago Silva, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Marcos Alonso. Summer arrival Silva is set to be rested by Lampard, shot-stopper Kepa continues to nurse a shoulder injury, whilst Spanish full-back Alonso will be suspended for the clash: No Thiago Silva as he has been rested for Krasnodar, Kepa still injured and Alonso suspended. Expect big changes for this one in Russia tomorrow. #CFC #UCL pic.twitter.com/URfZiMJwE4 — Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) October 27, 2020 One individual, on the other hand, who could be in line for a surprise return to the visitors’ starting XI at the Krasnodar Stadium, is Antonio Rudiger. After reports began to mount in the media last night that German stopper Rudiger, frozen out to this point in the campaign, had held ‘constructive’ talks with manager Lampard, the latter has since confirmed as much. In fact, the Chelsea boss, after assuring that he maintains a positive bond with his out-of-favour defender, went on to reveal that Rudiger is in line for a potential return to starting duties on Wednesday: Frank Lampard, at the start of his part of the media conference, says he has had discussions with Toni Rudiger and that he has a positive relationship with him. He adds that Rudiger is very much in contention to play. #KRACHE — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) October 27, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
