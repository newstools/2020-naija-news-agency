Sheffield United have this evening confirmed the signing of Rhian Brewster from Premier League rivals Liverpool. Brewster, 20, had long been viewed as one of the most highly-regarded young talents on Liverpool’s books, since making the move to Merseyside from Chelsea’s academy in 2015. Such a viewpoint was certainly justified last season, when, in his first prolonged experience of senior football, the English youth international starred during a 6-month loan spell in the Championship. Across 22 league appearances with Swansea City, Brewster racked up a hugely impressive 11 goals. Despite his stellar exploits at the Liberty Stadium, however, the route to consistent first-team football at Anfield remained largely blocked upon his return this past summer. As things stand, Jurgen Klopp of course has all of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Divock Origi, Xherdan Shaqiri, Takumi Minamino and summer arrival Diogo Jota to choose from in attack. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272130753-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272130753-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272130753-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272130753-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 12: Mohamed Salah of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s fourth goal during the Premier League match between Liverpool and Leeds United at Anfield on September 12, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

Surprisingly, however, such reports hinted at a permanent departure, rather than another loan. And, as outlined above, such a move is precisely what has come to fruition on Friday. In an announcement released a short time ago, Sheffield United confirmed that they have clinched Brewster’s signing on a permanent basis, for a club-record fee. The youngster has put pen to paper on a deal at Bramall Lane through to 2025.
