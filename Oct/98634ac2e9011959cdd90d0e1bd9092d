Updates on the fitness of a whole host of star players have been forthcoming on Friday, ahead of the latest round of Premier League fixtures. Gameweek 6 of the English top-flight campaign is set to get underway later this evening. The first fixture of the weekend will see high-flying Aston Villa welcome Leeds United to Villa Park. Elsewhere, champions Liverpool are set to take on Sheffield United at Anfield, table-toppers Everton face a trip to Southampton, whilst Arsenal’s meeting with Leicester City should prove an action-packed affair. Saturday’s fixtures are headlined, meanwhile, by Manchester United and Chelsea facing off at Old Trafford. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (L) and Chelsea’s English head coach Frank Lampard gesture at the final whistle during the English League Cup fourth round football match between Chelsea and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in London on October 30, 2019.

And, as outlined above, ahead of what should prove another drama-filled weekend of top-flight football in England, fitness updates on the star performers of a whole host of sides have today been forthcoming. Beginning with the ‘top-6’, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Edinson Cavani is in line for his debut in Manchester United’s colours, whilst both Harry Maguire and Mason Greenwood are also in contention to return. The Red Devils’ opponents this weekend, meanwhile, have been dealt more or less a clean bill of health, with just Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was unlikely to start anyway, having joined long-term absentee Billy Gilmour on the Chelsea treatment table. Some injury news before the weekend’s game…#MUNCHE — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) October 23, 2020 Speaking in his pre-Sheffield United press conference, Jurgen Klopp confirmed that, as things stand, question marks remain surrounding the potential involvement of Liverpool trio Thiago Alcantara, Alisson and Joel Matip. Sadio Mane, though, will be fit to feature after being forced off versus Ajax during the week. Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, remained coy on the potential involvement of Jamie Vardy in Leicester’s meeting with Arsenal: ‘We’ll see where Jamie’s at. He’ll train with the squad on Friday.’ ‘We felt he would miss two games, so he’s worked well with the medical team over the course of the week. Hopefully, he comes through that over the next 48 hours and is available for the squad.’ <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185289410-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185289410-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185289410-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185289410-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 03: Jamie Vardy of Leicester City during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Leicester City at Selhurst Park on November 03, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Chloe Knott – Danehouse/Getty Images) One Premier League striker who is certain to play no part this weekend, though, is Gabriel Jesus. The Manchester City star remains out of action, and will of course be joined by fellow countryman Fernandinho in watching on from the sidelines when the Sky Blues face West Ham. The Hammers, on the other hand, should be able to call on Michail Antonio (who has been struggling with a hamstring issue), confirmed David Moyes. Elsewhere, there is concerning news for Crystal Palace, with all of Gary Cahill, Jordan Ayew, Jack Butland and Wayne Hennessey set to miss out when Roy Hodgson’s men take on Fulham. A squad update from the boss ahead of #FULCRY#CPFC | https://t.co/utMcYSDkhb — Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) October 23, 2020 Table-toppers Everton have been handed a potential boost in the form of news that James Rodriguez could return sooner than expected to face Southampton, though Seamus Coleman and Jonjoe Kenny remain out of action. The Saints, meanwhile, will be without Moussa Djenepo, Theo Walcott and Will Smallbone. Stuart Armstrong, however, is in contention to return. Last up is an update courtesy of Newcastle boss Steve Bruce. The Magpies face a tricky trip to Wolves on Sunday evening, with Karl Darlow looking set to be a game-time decision. Bruce and co. are also sweating over the match fitness of both Miguel Almiron and Isaac Hayden, though the former looks more likely to be in from the off at Molineux.
