Liverpool’s meeting with West Ham United this evening saw Diogo Jota emerge from the bench to make the difference for Jurgen Klopp’s men. The champions returned to Premier League action a short time ago, in a meeting with David Moyes’ outfit at Anfield. Klopp’s hosts headed into proceedings amid an upturn in form over the last couple of weeks, which had seen them bag a trio of consecutive wins across all competitions. The latest of these came during the week, when Liverpool made it 6 points from 6 in their Champions League group, courtesy of a 2-0 downing of Danish outfit Midtjylland. Nevertheless, the Reds were no doubt aware that they would have their work cut out this evening, with West Ham having also thoroughly impressed of late. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-893881702-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="David Moyes" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-893881702-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-893881702-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="David Moyes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-893881702-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="David Moyes" data-recalc-dims="1" /> STOKE ON TRENT, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 16: David Moyes, Manager of West Ham United celebrates victory after the Premier League match between Stoke City and West Ham United at Bet365 Stadium on December 16, 2017 in Stoke on Trent, England.

West Ham actually took the lead in the clash, when Pablo Fornals slotted home a pinpoint effort from the edge of the box, following Joe Gomez’s weak clearance. Liverpool pulled level shortly before the interval, though, when, after Arthur Masuaku needlessly felled Mo Salah in the Hammers’ box, the Egyptian dusted himself down, before slamming home beyond Lukasz Fabianski. 18 – Liverpool have scored each of the last 18 penalties they have taken in all competitions (excluding shootouts), with Mo Salah himself netting his last 13 for the club.

With just 5 minutes remaining, and proceedings inching towards stalemate, though, Liverpool struck. Diogo Jota was the man on target, shortly after being introduced off the bench. After being slipped in courtesy of a gorgeous Xherdan Shaqiri assist, the Portuguese attacker slotted home at the near post with minimal fuss, securing a potentially crucial 3 points for Liverpool, and sending the champions back to the summit of the Premier League table in the process.

The man in question is aforementioned match-winner Jota, following another dazzling cameo for his new side versus West Ham. Questions were of course asked when Liverpool opted to splash out a rumoured £45 million to coax the former Wolves standout to Merseyside last month. However, to say that he has since gone about putting such doubts firmly to bed would be an understatement. Despite having lined out for the Reds on just 9 occasions thus far, Jota’s impact has been clear. The Portuguese international has added some much-needed depth to Jurgen Klopp’s frontline, with his ability to line out in a variety of attacking positions a huge plus. His influence was instantaneous this evening, as, with Liverpool majorly struggling to break down a stout West Ham backline, Jota added a new element of guile and vigour to the hosts, first having a goal disallowed, before netting the game’s winner moments later. And the 23-year-old’s strike, as well as proving key from a team perspective, also came as a significant one on an individual basis. As has since been revealed online, Jota has now managed to net in all of his first 3 home Premier League appearances in Liverpool’s colours. This makes the ex-Wolves man just the 2nd player to have achieved such a feat, joining former Reds attacker Luis Garcia in the history books of his new club: Diogo Jota has scored in each of his first 3 PL home games for @LFC He’s only the second player to achieve this in Liverpool’s PL history, after Luis Garcia in October 2004 pic.twitter.com/hMW7dJZepp — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) October 31, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
