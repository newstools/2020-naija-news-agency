Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has spoken out over the situation of out-of-favour Gunners star Mesut Ozil once again this weekend, insisting that he has been both ‘patient and fair’ in his treatment of the midfielder. Much of the media chatter surrounding ongoings at the Emirates of late has of course centered on German international Ozil. This comes with Mikel Arteta having doubled down on his efforts to freeze the former Real Madrid man out of his first-team setup. Upon Spanish tactician Arteta taking the reins in north London late last year, Ozil’s initial experiences actually proved quite positive. The 32-year-old was afforded a consistent string of starts by his new boss, suggesting that he was set to prove central to the plans of Arteta moving forward. Bizarrely, however, since football’s return on the back of the initial Covid-19 outbreak during the summer, Ozil has not received a single minute of playing time. Arteta, meanwhile, has made crystal clear that this situation is unlikely to change any time soon, through a pair of high-profile calls over the last couple of weeks. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

And this was swiftly followed by news that the gifted midfielder had also not been afforded a place in the Gunners’ 25-man Premier League panel. Arsenal’s Premier League squad in full.

Arteta, though, has continued to stand firm in his stance regarding the German, and, this weekend, provided a further insight into his position. Speaking during an interview with Sky Sports, the Gunners boss assured that he did everything within his power to afford Ozil the fullest possible opportunity to prove himself. In the end, though, Arteta evidently felt as though the experienced creator simply didn’t do enough: ‘What I can tell you that I tried my best, I tried to give him as many opportunities as I could.’ ‘And that from my own side, I’ve been patient, given him opportunities and been fair.’ The Spaniard continued: ‘He’s a player that belongs to a football club, he’s been a really important player in the last few seasons. I have to respect that, I’m here to make decisions, the best decisions for the team and for the club.’ ‘This is what I try to do and then I have to explain them because people need the reasons and the right answers. I just give mine, whether they believe me or agree with me or not, there’s nothing I can do.’ ‘But I have to put my decisions, with my heart and with my brain to make the right decisions that I believe are good.’ ”What I can tell you that I tried my best, I tried to give him as many opportunities as I could” Mikel Arteta explains the reasoning behind Mesut Ozil’s omission from Arsenal’s squad pic.twitter.com/zHDCaweJlz — Football Daily (@footballdaily) October 30, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
