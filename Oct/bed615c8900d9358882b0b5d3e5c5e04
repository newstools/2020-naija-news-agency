Everton face a trip to Southampton on Sunday afternoon as they look to continue their superb start to the campaign. The Toffees did some solid transfer business over the summer, however, it is hard to imagine anyone predicting just what a sensational start to 2020/221 Everton would have. Everton are yet to lose a single tie across all competitions this term, and began game week six sitting pretty atop of the English top-flight. As for Southampton, they endured something of a rough start to the season, losing two on the bounce. However, the Saints are now unbeaten in three, with their last league tie seeing them put three past Chelsea to earn a key point. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280764830-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280764830-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280764830-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280764830-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 17: James Rodriguez of Everton during the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park on October 17 2020 in Liverpool, England.

However, Carlo Ancelotti has recently been explaining what he thinks Everton need to do to be in with a chance of see off their opponents on the south coast. First up, the Italian stated that though Everton have had a good start, they need to show consistency in every game: “The start to the season was good but we need to show consistency in every game. “We showed good spirit, good football, against one of the best teams in Liverpool. “We would like to show the same on Sunday.This is how you can judge the consistency of the team. “Game by game, you have to show the same quality and spirit and football. “It is possible to show some improvement, sometimes. This is what we ask for on Sunday.” Ancelotti then went on to add that his side need to be smart with the ball whilst also being at 100 per cent: “It will be a tough game. Southampton is a team with a really clear identity. They try to play with high intensity without the ball. They are really compact and it is difficult to find space to play. “We have to be smart and clever with the ball. If we are clever with the ball, we have a chance to win the game. “To win against them you have to be 100 per cent. I would like to be at 100 per cent because our target is to win.” Quotes via Everton’s official website.
