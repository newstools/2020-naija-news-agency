Barcelona youngster Ansu Fati has this afternoon been named the La Liga Player of the Month for September. 17-year-old Blaugrana wide-man Ansu has enjoyed a fine start to the new campaign. The Spanish international has been handed a central role by new Barca boss Ronald Koeman, starting in all 3 of the club’s league outings. And to say that he has gone on to repay the faith of the Dutchman would be putting it lightly. Ansu has managed to rack up 3 goals and an assist over the early weeks of the season, securing Man of the Match honours versus both Villarreal and Celta Vigo. Such exploits have helped Barcelona to a solid start in their pursuit to reclaim La Liga supremacy, with the Catalans having bagged 7 points from an available 9 thus far. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278485818-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278485818-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278485818-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278485818-1024x700.jpg?resize=1024%2C700&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – OCTOBER 04: Ansu Fati of FC Barcelona controls the ball during the La Liga Santander match between FC Barcelona and Sevilla FC at Camp Nou on October 04, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.
