Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has opened up on the new dimension which Thomas Partey is set to add to his midfield, on the back of the 27-year-old’s deadline day arrival at the club. The news that Gunners fans around the globe were waiting for was finally forthcoming on Monday night. This of course came in the form of Thomas Partey’s move to the club. Following a lengthy saga, spanning the majority of the summer, Mikel Arteta secured long overdue reinforcements to his side’s midfield in the final hours of the transfer window. After Atletico Madrid first confirmed the deal, Arsenal’s announcement followed a short time later, with Partey set to ply his trade at the Emirates over the course of the season ahead: @Thomaspartey22 has joined us from Atletico Madrid on a long-term contract#NoThomasNoPartey — Arsenal (@Arsenal) October 5, 2020 Whilst the arrivals of fellow summer reinforcements Willian and Gabriel Magalhaes of course improved Arsenal, it is Partey’s addition, in the eyes of most, which is set to prove most pivotal in pushing the north Londoners back towards the upper echelons of the Premier League. The Ghanaian is the complete midfield package, combining technical ability, tenacity, and equal will to both drive his side forward and break up the attacks of opposing sides. This of course represents the kind of all-round presence which has so long been lacking from the ranks in the middle of the park at the Emirates. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210079026-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – March 01: Thomas Partey #5 of Atletico Madrid in action during the Espanyol V Atletico Madrid, La Liga regular season match at RCDE Stadium on March 1st 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.

Speaking in an interview with Arsenal’s official website, the Spaniard was first drawn on why exactly he and the Gunners opted to pursue the former Atletico man: ‘We identified him a few months ago and we have been following his progress, and obviously the more you know about the squad, you know more about where you think you can improve it.’ ‘We believe he has the right qualities, with his character and his personality and as well with his technical qualities and positional options that he can give to the team.’ Arteta was then pressed on how he plans to utilise Partey as part of his midfield setup, with the Gunners boss having been keen to highlight the flexibility opened up by the 27-year-old’s presence in his squad: ‘I think he allows us to play different formations and he can fit in within those formations in different positions, which is a really good thing to have in a squad where, in midfield, I think we were a little bit short.’ ‘I have a few things in mind that I want to start to train with the team and [Partey’s signing] is going to give us more adaptability & balance in defending and attacking transitions & the way we have to set up certain structures to attack better in certain moments of the game.’ Wondering how @Thomaspartey22 will fit into @m8arteta‘s plans?
