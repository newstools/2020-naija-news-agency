Manchester United star Paul Pogba has admitted that he remains keen on a move to La Liga giants Real Madrid. For the first summer in some time, speculation surrounding the future of Red Devils midfielder Pogba proved largely subdued over the last couple of months. The Frenchman endured a somewhat hit-and-miss campaign at Old Trafford in 2019/20, with a series of ankle problems having restricted him to just 16 Premier League appearances. Significantly, though, 9 of these outings came on the back of the Covid-19 enforced break, with Pogba having gone on to play a key role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men clinching a top-4 berth. The 27-year-old also formed an encouraging partnership alongside Bruno Fernandes at the heart of United’s midfield, with Pogba, all told, having looked genuinely content in the colours of the Manchester giants as the campaign drew to a close. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1223645368-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1223645368-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1223645368-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1223645368-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes (L) celebrates scoring their second goal with Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba (R) during the English Premier League football match between Brighton and Hove Albion and Manchester United at the American Express Community Stadium in Brighton, southern England on June 30, 2020.

As outlined above, however, just when it appeared as though the transfer chiefs at Old Trafford could rest easy regarding the future of their star midfielder, Pogba, at the first opportunity, has hinted at a desire to move on. Speaking in a press conference on the back of France’s drubbing of Ukraine, the former Juventus man was drawn on a host of topics. One such subject surrounded his future, with a particular emphasis on the interest of fellow countryman and Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane in his signature. And Pogba was not at all coy in his response, admitting that lining out in the colours of Los Blancos remains ‘a dream’: ‘We have all heard that things have been said. What to say? Yes, all footballers would love to play for Real Madrid. It might be a dream.’ ‘It is a dream for me, why not one day?’ The Frenchman, though, was also keen to reaffirm his ‘love’ for Manchester United: ‘But I play for Manchester United and I love my club. I perform for Manchester United, I have fun and I want to do everything to put the club where it deserves to be.’ ‘I will give my maximum, like my team-mates.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
