Since signing for Liverpool in January of 2018, Virgil van Dijk has gone on to cement himself as one of the best, if not the best, central defender in world football. The Dutchman played a key role in transforming Liverpool’s previously shaky backline into one of the best in the Premier League. Such impressive form has seen the 29-year-old garner countless major honours in recent times. As well as guiding Liverpool to a Premier League title and their 6th Champions League, VVD has also been named the Premier League Player of the Season, the UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and the PFA Players’ Player of the Year. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1147532466.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1147532466.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1147532466.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1147532466.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MADRID, SPAIN – JUNE 1: Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool FC, with the trophy during the UEFA Champions League match between Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool at the Wanda Metropolitano on June 1, 2019 in Madrid Spain (Photo by David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images) However, despite his impressive exploits over the last two or so years, van Dijk’s form is now being questioned by a Premier League great. Liverpool, of course, somehow managed to concede seven vs Aston Villa last weekend with nobody from the Reds side, not even van Dijk, covering themselves in glory from that clash. Now, former Arsenal defender Sol Campbell has been speaking about the Dutchman. And though Campbell states that van Dijk is head and shoulders above everyone else, the Englishman also voiced the opinion that perhaps having such a spotlight on him is hampering the Liverpool centre-half. Campbell also speculated that perhaps van Dijk has not been challenged enough and has now ‘come unstuck’: “I know Van Dijk struggled in the Villa game, but he stands out these days because he’s head and shoulders above everyone else, which makes me wonder if that is hampering him at the same time. “He’s the complete player in that position and has made it look easy, but maybe he’s not been challenged enough and then, like a cricketer being done by a slower ball, he’s come unstuck.” Quotes via the Mail.
