An update on Spurs’ swoop for Swansea City defender Joe Rodon has been forthcoming on Sunday evening. Tottenham of course proved one of the busier Premier League clubs on the transfer front this summer. The usually cautious Daniel Levy and co. threw caution to the wind, to add 5 high-profile additions to Jose Mourinho’s squad. First up was Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, who arrived from Southampton early in August. This was followed by Republic of Ireland international Matt Doherty’s signing from Wolves. An impressive double deal for Real Madrid pair Sergio Reguilon and Gareth Bale was then forthcoming last month, before Spurs finally secured long overdue backup for Harry Kane – in the form of Benfica’s Carlos Vinicius. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 04: Sergio Reguilon of Tottenham Hotspur during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on October 04, 2020 in Manchester, England.

The Lilywhites are said to remain keen on adding a new defender to the club’s ranks. With the international transfer market having of course slammed shut for Premier League sides, though, Spurs have been forced to turn their attentions to the Championship, and one player in particular – Joe Rodon. Swansea City stalwart Rodon has long been viewed as one of the Championship’s finest in his position, with most of the opinion that the Welsh international is now ready to make the step up to England’s top-tier. And one such individual is evidently Jose Mourinho. As per Mike McGrath of the Telegraph, Spurs are preparing to step up their pursuit of Rodon. After being frustrated in their most recent round of negotiations with Swansea, a fresh proposal on the part of the north Londoners now appears imminent, though it is noted that the clubs ‘remain apart on valuation’. .@mcgrathmike‘s transfer notebook: Tottenham to step up talks with Swansea over deal for Joe Rodon https://t.co/90iIk6TAZG — Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) October 11, 2020 On top of Swansea’s demands, however, another potential stumbling block in Tottenham’s Rodon pursuit could well come in the form of late competition from a Premier League rival. This comes amid claims that Leicester City are now expressing a keen interest in the 22-year-old. News on the Foxes’ pursuit comes courtesy of Alan Nixon of the Sun. Brendan Rodgers is said to be a firm believer in Rodon’s talents. However, significantly, it is also added that the Leicester boss would rather wait until January, or possibly even next summer to sign the stopper, to ensure that recent arrival Wesley Fofana is handed sufficient game-time to settle in England.
