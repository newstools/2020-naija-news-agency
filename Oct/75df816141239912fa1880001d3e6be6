The song titled Yahoo Yahoo (EndSars) which features label mate Flaym Bee and Kaylax digs deep into the manner at which the men of the police/Fsars upon sighting any Nigerian youth who is well dressed, has dreads, wears rugged jeans, tints hair, drives a car, has an Apple iphone or good gadgets, is dubbed a fraudster and what follows is their usual threats, abduction, kidnapping and extortion. Over the last few years this has lead to multiple deaths of young budding and hardworking Nigerian youths who could not succum to the threats and are thus shot, killed and labeled criminals. In the last 2years, about over 500,000 Nigerian youths has been either killed, totured or extorted by the men of the Police/Fsars. https://tooxclusive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Androidd-Feat.-Flaym-Bee-x-Kaylax-Yahoo-Yahoo-EndSars.mp3 DOWNLOAD MP3 The post Androidd Ft Flaym Bee x Kaylax – “Yahoo Yahoo” (EndSars) appeared first on tooXclusive.
