Italian giants Juventus have this evening confirmed the news that Cristiano Ronaldo has recovered from his lengthy battle with Covid-19. The major talking point at the Allianz Stadium of late has of course surrounded the absence of star man Ronaldo. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid standout has not featured for Juve since prior to the international break. This comes with Ronaldo having arrived back in Turin following his latest stint with Portugal with Covid-19. The 5-time Ballon d’Or winner had since struggled to shake the virus, and, despite posting numerous positive updates regarding his wellbeing on social media, therefore missed the Bianconeri’s last 4 outings. Andrea Pirlo’s men majorly struggled across this stretch, managing just a solitary victory, to go along with 2 draws and a defeat. Their latest outing, on Wednesday night, meanwhile, saw Ronaldo’s leadership and cutting edge badly missed, as Pirlo’s questionable tactics eventually led to Juve being put to the sword by 2 goals to nil at home to Barcelona. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254253723-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254253723-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254253723-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1254253723-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> TURIN, ITALY – JULY 04: Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal during the Serie A match between Juventus and Torino FC at Allianz Stadium on July 04, 2020 in Turin, Italy.

And, as outlined above, on Friday, following a 19-day wait, the news that all associated with Juve were waiting for has finally been forthcoming. In a post across the club’s social media platforms, the Old Lady announced that Ronaldo has returned a negative coronavirus test, and will now be available for selection to Andrea Pirlo. Fitness permitting, he could even feature in the club’s Serie A clash with Spezia on Sunday. Cristiano Ronaldo carried out a check with a diagnostic test (swab) for Covid 19. The exam provided a negative result. The player has, therefore, recovered after 19 days and is no longer subjected to home isolation. . @Cristiano recovers from Covid-19https://t.co/4etecyAw0O pic.twitter.com/YPZSm0My8A — JuventusFC (@juventusfcen) October 30, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
