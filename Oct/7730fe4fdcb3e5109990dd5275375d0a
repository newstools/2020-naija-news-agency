Real Madrid were humbled on their own turf against Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk. Shakhtar were without as many as 10 first team players due to coronavirus complications. Zinedine Zidane fielded a strong Los Blancos side ahead of El Classico at the weekend. There was rotation but mainly in the forward line. Luka Jovic in for Karim Benzema and Rodrygo in for Vinicius Junior. Marco Asensio started on the right and was spritely in the opening minutes. However, Shakhtar shocked Madrid by going 3-0 up before half time. The Los Blancos defence having a torrid time with Raphael Varane scoring an own goal and Eder Militao losing concentration completely to allow Manor Soloman to sneak in and score the third. Madrid did fight back in the second half after Zidane brought on Benzema and Vinicius however it was not enough. Los Blancos could only find two goals through a fantastic Modric strike and a Vinicius finish. The loss leaves Madrid in a tricky situation in a group with Inter Milan and Borussia Monchengladbach. Zidane spoke after the game and has been very honest in taking responsibility.
