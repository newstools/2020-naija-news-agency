He promised to hit the street again on Tuesday, the 13th of October 2020 if changes weren't implemented. The ‚ÄúBop Daddy‚Äù crooner, fulfilled his promise by backing his words with action. In the video below, he was spotted at Lekki toll gate with other protesters and he had the following to say: We are still out because they made an announcement that SARS has ended, just yesterday Protesters were shot and killed here in Lagos and all over the country, different parts of the country. Protesters are still detained for simply exercising their fundamental human rights. If you are really serious about Police reform, if SARS has really ended then why are we seeing different forms of police misconduct. He went further to address other issues with Protesters agreeing to his plight. Watch video: If the government is serious about police reform, they will grant us our 5 for 5 ‚Äì Falz <img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270a-1f3ff.png?ssl=1" alt="‚úäüèø" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270a-1f3ff.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270a-1f3ff.png?ssl=1" alt="‚úäüèø" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270a-1f3ff.png?ssl=1" alt="‚úäüèø" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1f3-1f1ec.png?ssl=1" alt="üá≥üá¨" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1f3-1f1ec.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1f3-1f1ec.png?ssl=1" alt="üá≥üá¨" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1f3-1f1ec.png?ssl=1" alt="üá≥üá¨" data-recalc-dims="1" /> #SARSMUSTENDNOW #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria pic.twitter.com/R0khlZDoNp ‚Äî Daddy GeeHoe (@JrAnthoony_) October 13, 2020 The post #EndSARSnow: Falz Back To The Street Protesting appeared first on Most Trusted Voice in Music & Afrobeats from Nigeria & Africa | Notjustok.
