Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi this evening etched his name further into the history books of the Champions League. The Blaugrana got their European campaign underway a short time ago, in a meeting with Ferencvaros in Catalunya. Ronald Koeman’s men headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, having fallen to a concerning 1-0 defeat at the hands of Getafe at the weekend. Nevertheless, Barca, for obvious reasons, were viewed as overwhelming favourites ahead of kick-off, and have since made short work of their inexperienced opponents. As things stand, the hosts lead by 3 goals to nil. The evening’s opener came shortly before the half-hour mark, courtesy of a familiar source. A trademark moment of individual brilliance on the part of Lionel Messi saw the Argentine dance by a trio of Ferencvaros players, before being downed in the visitors’ box. Messi quickly dusted himself down, before stepping up to slot the ensuing spot-kick away with typical class.

As outlined above, however, it is the Blaugrana’s first of the night which has since seen the club’s star man add yet another record to his burgeoning collection. In finding the net versus Ferencvaros, Lionel Messi extended his streak of notching in the Champions League to 16 straight seasons. The 33-year-old is the only player in history to have managed such a feat, with few likely to bet against him adding to his record-breaking streak in 2021/22: Lionel Messi is the first player in Champions League history to score in 16 consecutive campaigns: ✓ 2005-06✓ 2006-07✓ 2007-08✓ 2008-09✓ 2009-10✓ 2010-11✓ 2011-12✓ 2012-13✓ 2013-14✓ 2014-15✓ 2015-16✓ 2016-17✓ 2017-18✓ 2018-19✓ 2019-20✓ 2020-21 pic.twitter.com/q99hPevRBf — Squawka Football (@Squawka) October 20, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
