Week six of the Premier League season draws to a close on Monday evening. The final tie of the gameweek will see Tottenham make the trip to Burnley. Spurs head into the clash in solid form, having secured a comfortable 3-0 win over LASK in their Europa League opener during the week. However, the Lilywhites did blow a three-goal lead in their last league outing vs West Ham.

Sean Dyche’s side have had a pretty awful start to the campaign, which has seen them pick up just a solitary point in the Premier League.

The Welshman was, of course, handed his first start since re-joining Spurs earlier this week in the Europe League. Bale put on a solid showing, which saw him force a LASK player to direct the ball into his own net as Spurs went on to garner a 3-0 win. However, when speaking recently, the Spurs legend has warned that he still needs some time to get his match fitness and sharpness up: “It’s going to take me a bit of time to get my match fitness and sharpness going. “It’s another game towards the process of getting fitter, sharper, quicker. I just enjoyed being out there playing football – that’s what makes me happy.” Quotes via Goal.
