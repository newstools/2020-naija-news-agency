Your child has a fever. Fever is very common in childhood, especially in children who attend daycare, crèche or kindergarten. You might have noticed that during the lockdown, you didn’t have to take your child to the hospital very often or not at all because they were at home and didn’t fall ill. All kids get a fever from time to time. It is mostly a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Even though it is harmless, it can be a cause for concern. Most of the time, once the cause of the fever is taken care of, your child starts to get better. A fever occurs when your child’s body temperature is higher than normal. Your child’s average body temperature ranges from 36.4 to 37.3 degree centigrade. Most people’s body temperature changes a little bit during the course of the day; it’s usually a little lower in the morning and a little higher in the evening, and can vary as kids run around, play, and exercise. There are two types of fever grades: low-grade fever is a temperature range from >37.4 to 37.9 degree centigrade; high-grade fever is temperature range from 38 degree centigrade and above. A fever helps the body fight infections by stimulating natural defense mechanisms. Recognizing a fever can enable you to get treatment and proper monitoring for it. It’s important to remember that fever, by itself, is not an illness. It’s usually a sign or symptom of another problem. A fever is usually caused by an infection somewhere in the body. Let me make a few things clear: teething does not cause fever. Although there might be a slight increase in body temperature during the period, it is not enough to cause a fever. Also, malaria isn’t the only reason your child has a fever, the same way antibiotics aren’t the cure for every cough and catarrh. But that’s a story for another day. The causes of a fever include: Your child may: See your doctor if: When speaking to your doctor, make sure to tell them all your child’s symptoms and temperature readings. Your doctor will examine your child and carry out some laboratory investigations. This will help them determine the cause of the fever and an effective course of treatment. If you’re ever in doubt about what to do, what a fever might mean, or if your child is acting ill in a way that concerns you even if there’s no fever, always call your doctor for advice. *** Photo by nappy from Pexels Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health providers with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
