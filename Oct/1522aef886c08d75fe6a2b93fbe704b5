Tottenham and Burnley are set to play out the final clash of game week seven this coming Monday. Spurs head into the tie in decent form, though they did ship three goals in their last league outings vs West Ham. Regardless, Jose Mourinho and co. will no doubt be extremely confident of getting a result against the Clarets. Burnley do not have a great record against the ‘top-six’ clubs and have actually beaten Spurs just once in the last decade. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 23: Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho looks on ahead of the Premier League match between West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur at London Stadium on November 23, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images) Burnley have also had a pretty dismal start to 2020/21, picking up a solitary point from their first four league outings. As a result, most will no doubt be predicting a tough outing for Burnley on Monday evening. One man who is seemingly expecting a real test is Burnley boss Sean Dyche. Speaking on Thursday, Dyche discussed how he is hoping to play a style which is awkward for the north Londoners: “We will look to play effectively and a style that is awkward and hard to get grip of. “They are in good form and have top players.” Dyche then went on to heap praise on Harry Kane and Jose Mourinho: “We have got things from the games against them before. They have one of the top players in the country in Harry Kane. It is not about individuals but he is a top, top player. “[Jose Mourinho] is in my mind a top manager. He is getting the team more how he likes it. They are maybe adapting to his thinking and the players adapting to the roles he wants. “And if you look at the squad they are top-class players so there is a chance they are going to do pretty well anyway so the manager’s job is to maximise that.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
