Arsenal have released a statement which details the need for Kieran Tierney to self-isolate for fourteen days. Stuart Armstrong of Southampton was deemed to have been in ‘close contact’ to Tierney. The midfielder tested positive for COVID-19. One other player and two members of the Scottish national team staff are also required to self-isolate. In the statement from the club, it reiterated that Tierney remained socially distant from others at all times. It went on to say that the club is seeking further ‘advice and clarification’ regarding the decision. The former Celtic left-back released a statement in response to the news. “I’m so disappointed and frustrated to be in this situation. I have adhered to all regulations and made sure I was socially distancing from my team mates in the hotel,” said the Scotland international. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1137101840.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1137101840.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1137101840.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1137101840.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GLASGOW, SCOTLAND – APRIL 14: Kieran Tierney of Celtic applauds the fans at the final whistle during the Scottish Cup Semi Final between Aberdeen and Celtic at Hampden Park on April 14, 2019 in Glasgow, Scotland.

I know Arsenal and the SFA are now in discussions with the Scottish authorities to gain a further understanding.” Arsenal will be keen to find out if Tierney subsequently tests negative in a second test if he will be allowed to return to action before the 14-day period. Tierney would not be available for Arsenal’s trip to Manchester City if the quarantine is upheld. The game will be the first time since the FA Cup semi-final that the two sides have met. It will also be Gunners fans first opportunity to possibly see new signing Thomas Partey in an Arsenal shirt. With the midfielder joining from Atletico, there is hope that Arsenal can be more competitive. Especially in away ties against ‘top 6’ opposition. However, Tierney’s possible absence causes problems. Arteta has been looking to transition the 3-4-3 he had previously adopted into the 4-3-3, seen against Sheffield United. Left-back alternatives available to the Spaniard are defensively weaker. Sead Kolasinac’s proposed move to Bayer Leverkusen fell through on Deadline Day, Ainsley Maitland-Niles has also deputised at left-wing back and Bukayo Saka additionally has been fielded there. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273530878-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273530878-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273530878-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273530878-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Sead Kolasinac of Arsenal runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Arsenal and West Ham United at Emirates Stadium on September 19, 2020 in London, England.

Arteta, Tierney and many others will be hoping ‘further clarification’ allows the Scotsman to play against City.
