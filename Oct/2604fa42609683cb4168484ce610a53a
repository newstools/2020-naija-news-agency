Mesut Ozil’s statement in response to being left out of Arsenal’s Premier League squad was blunt to say the least. Highlighting a possible lack of loyalty from personnel within the club. Yet maintaining he intends to continue his fight not to let his time at Arsenal end on a sour note. In Arteta’s press conference ahead of Arsenal’s Europa League tie against Rapid Wien, the Spaniard responded. “Everybody is free to express his feeling. That’s just a football decision that my conscious is really calm. I’ve been really fair with him, my level of communication with him has been really high,” said Arteta. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195215659-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195215659-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195215659-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195215659-1024x714.jpg?resize=1024%2C714&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 21: Edu Arsenal Technical Director chats to Mikel Arteta Arsenal Head Coach before the Premier League match between Everton FC and Arsenal FC at Goodison Park on December 21, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

I have to say that I try to look everybody in the eye and be comfortable with it. With Mesut I have this feeling because I was being very straightforward since I arrived at this club.” Arteta did mention that he felt he had previously seen some good in Ozil’s performances. “Here I feel at the moment today that I want the best possible Mesut for the team.” “In some moments I was able to get close to that, at the moment I haven’t been able to do it because I have to make the decision to leave him out of the squad.” Arteta was quick to claim he himself is the sole reason for why Ozil has been left out. “Honestly I take full responsibility. I have to be the one getting the best out of the players. It’s my responsibility. It’s nothing relating to any behaviour or, like I read, the paycuts. It’s not true.” “It’s my decision. If someone has to blame me – and it will happen when we lose football matches – my responsibility. I have to make the decisions to get the best possible squad in order to win football matches and competitions as often as we can.” “In order to do that I try to be fair with him and any other players and defend as much as possible the interests of the football club.” Former Gunner Jack Wilshere has had his say on the matter. Having missed plenty of football through injury, Wilshere is no stranger to watching on from the side-lines.
