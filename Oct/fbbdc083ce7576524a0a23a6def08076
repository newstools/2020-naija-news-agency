Updates on the respective futures of a pair of Arsenal youngsters have been forthcoming on Friday. First up comes the latest on Matteo Guendouzi. French midfielder Guendouzi departed north London on loan ahead of the transfer deadline, making the move to Bundesliga outfit Hertha Berlin for the 2020/21 campaign. The 21-year-old’s exit of course came with Guendouzi having slipped majorly down the pecking order at the Emirates over the final months of last season. He was accused of taunting a number of Brighton’s stars over finances during a defeat at the Amex back in June, and has since failed to garner a single appearance. As such, with Mikel Arteta having made abundantly clear that he is not afraid to completely freeze out members of his Arsenal squad (just ask Mesut Ozil), many had since assumed Guendouzi’s career in the English capital to be all but over. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165483926-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Matteo Guendouzi" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165483926-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165483926-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Matteo Guendouzi" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1165483926-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Matteo Guendouzi" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s French midfielder Matteo Guendouzi celebrates after Arsenal’s Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang latched onto Guendouzi’s pass to score their second goal to equalise 2-2 during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates Stadium in London on September 1, 2019.

During an interview with French outlet Canal+, Guendouzi was asked directly whether reviving his career at the Emirates is out of the question. The midfielder, however, went on to explain: ‘It is not that, I just really needed to play this year, a new challenge.’ ‘That was the most important thing for me. I am still young, I am only 21, so playing time was the top priority for me. So Hertha Berlin, I know that I will be able to express myself in a magnificent league.’ The 2nd update concerning one of Arsenal’s young talents to have come to the fore on Friday, meanwhile, surrounds William Saliba. French stopper Saliba arrived in north London this summer, a full year after putting pen to paper on a deal with the Gunners. He has since not managed a single appearance for the capital giants, though, amid fierce competition in Arsenal’s backline. And, if the latest word stemming from the media is to be believed, then this comes with Mikel Arteta having evidently come to the conclusion that Saliba is not yet ready to start for a top Premier League club on a weekly basis. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1174462355.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 13: William Saliba of Arsenal during a training session at London Colney on September 13, 2019 in St Albans, England.

As per the reliable Charles Watts of Goal, Gunners transfer chiefs are currently in negotiations with a number of Championship clubs, over a temporary deal for Saliba. Brentford are one such club mentioned, though it is added that: ‘Arsenal will not rush into making a decision as they know the importance of picking the right destination for the teenager.’ The domestic transfer window in England is set to slam shut on October 16th. One week left of the domestic window and Arsenal are discussing William Saliba’s immediate future with several Championship clubs.
