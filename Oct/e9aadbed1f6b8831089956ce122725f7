Speculation in the English media on Monday suggests that Liverpool are considering Ben White as a potential winter reinforcement. Speculation surrounding the future of Seagulls stopper White of course proved rampant over the summer. This came on the back of a stellar campaign spent with Leeds in the Championship. White played a starring role for the Peacocks in 2019/20, starting all 46 of the club’s league outings, as Marcelo Bielsa’s men booked their spot back in the Premier League for the first time in 16 years. As such, news that the Championship title-winners held an interest in making White’s stay permanent subsequently came as little surprise. Leeds’ advances, however, were met by an unwavering stance on the part of Brighton: that the club’s gifted stopper was not for sale. This, in turn, eventually saw White put pen-to-paper on a new contract with his parent club, as the Englishman prepares to play a central role for Graham Potter’s men over the course of the season ahead: Ben White has agreed a new four-year contract with Albion, running to June 2024!  #BHAFC — Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) September 1, 2020 As outlined above, however, whilst, in the end, White was convinced to commit his long-term future to the Seagulls, a fresh approach could well see the 23-year-old tempted to seek out a move come January. This comes amid claims that Premier League champions Liverpool have identified White as a potential target. The news comes courtesy of Football Insider, on the back of the season-ending injury picked up by Virgil van Dijk over the weekend. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 17: (THE SUN OUT, THE SUN ON SUNDAY OUT )Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool collides with Everton’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park on October 17, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

As such, a dip into the winter market for defensive reinforcement looks likely, with White one of a number of options for the Reds. Whilst his lack of aerial prowess is earmarked as one potential concern, FI explain that: White is said to have scored excellent data metrics on Liverpool’s sophisticated tracking tools as the club assess centre-backs who can fit into Jurgen Klopp’s style of play.
