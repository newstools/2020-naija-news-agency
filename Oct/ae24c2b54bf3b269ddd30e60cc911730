Chelsea have this evening announced the club’s squad for the Premier League campaign ahead, with director Petr Cech bizarrely included. The delayed release of the 25-man squads of a number of English top-flight clubs were forthcoming on Tuesday. This of course comes with the opening of the 2020/21 campaign having been pushed back, following the summer pandemic. In turn, the domestic transfer window in England only slammed shut last week, with many sides having continued to reinforce until the final moments leading up to the deadline. Manchester United and Arsenal are two such clubs to have unveiled their latest Premier League panels today, with high-profile omissions featured in both. Sergio Romero and Phil Jones were both left out by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with Mikel Arteta having continued to stand firm in freezing out Mesut Ozil. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The individual in question? Petr Cech. Incredibly, the 38-year-old, who currently acts as technical and performance advisor at Stamford Bridge, has essentially come out of retirement (though it remains altogether unlikely that he will actually take to the pitch), to fill out the Blues’ squad. Chelsea have since provided an explanation for the decision, with Cech set to act as emergency cover between the posts in southwest London: ‘Petr Cech has been included in the squad as emergency goalkeeper cover.’ ‘This is a precautionary step due to the unprecedented conditions currently caused by the Covid-19 crisis. He takes up a position as a non-contract player.’ Chelsea’s 25-man Premier League squad in full: Kepa ArrizabalagaAntonio RudigerMarcos AlonsoAndreas Christensen – homegrownJorginhoThiago SilvaN’Golo KanteTammy Abraham – homegrownChristian PulisicTimo WernerWilly CaballeroFikayo Tomori – homegrownKurt ZoumaEdouard MendyMateo KovacicOlivier GiroudMason Mount – under-21Callum Hudson-Odoi – under-21Ben Chilwell – homegrownHakim ZiyechBilly Gilmour – under-21Reece James – under-21Cesar AzpilicuetaKai Havertz – under-21Emerson PalmieriPetr Cech ‘Petr Cech has been included in the squad as emergency goalkeeper cover.
