Jose Mourinho has spoken to the media ahead of Spurs’ Europa League tie against Antwerp. The Portuguese coach revealed the key injury absences, Bale’s possible inclusion and Heung-Min Son’s contract situation. “We left Dier behind because he comes with muscular injury from Monday night. Tanguy Ndombele not also coming because he felt little bit. We are not going to risk when have other options.” Mourinho continued, “Bale is playing. Bale is arriving and working very hard. He’s a great example for everybody. His behaviour as a team guy is incredible. I think tomorrow we can see Gareth at a good level and hopefully he can fly as he’s working very hard. He’s playing.” Asked about the South Korean’s contract situation Jose said, “He has three years of contract. I believe sooner or later it will be resolved. I don’t see any problem on that as a player with three years of contract.” After a blistering start to the campaign, Spurs and Daniel Levy will be determined to ensure his long-term future is with the North London club. Toby Alderweireld returns to his hometown having left Germinal Beerschot 16 years ago to join Ajax’s youth academy. However his homecoming has been tainted by the fact no fans will be in attendance. The Belgian international said, “It’s special to play in my home town. I’ve never played an official game here so it’s going be to special.” “I don’t really think about it that much. Of course I also miss Belgium. I am so happy at Spurs and it’s difficult to see the future. It’s not the moment to talk about it.” <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1255765720-1024x752.jpg?resize=1024%2C752&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1255765720-1024x752.jpg?resize=1024%2C752&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1255765720-1024x752.jpg?resize=1024%2C752&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1255765720-1024x752.jpg?resize=1024%2C752&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JULY 12: Toby Alderweireld of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates after scoring his sides second goal during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on July 12, 2020 in London, England.
