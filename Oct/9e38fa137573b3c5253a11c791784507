Wherever Jose Mourinho has gone the consistent thing besides entertaining press conferences and post-match interviews is controversy. Typically within the playing squad itself. Vitor Baia at Porto. Mario Balotelli at Inter Milan. Iker Casillas at Real Madrid. Juan Mata at Chelsea. Paul Pogba at Manchester United. The list isn’t restricted to one player per club either. At Tottenham, Dele Alli appears to be the new target of the Portuguese manager. Despite being kept at Spurs, even after multiple loan offers from PSG, Alli has continued to be exiled from the squad. Mourinho has stated that this is down to the pure strength of the squad. “You could see our team, I cannot start with all of them and I cannot have a bench without defenders or midfielders, he said. “In the same way the squad is a puzzle, the bench is also a little puzzle. “So to have on the bench Toby and Serge, and Moussa and Gio, and Lamela, and Bergwijn. “I cannot have on the bench four wingers or three wingers and a number 10, and then no defenders. Everything is a puzzle so in these matches that he stayed out, probably Tuesday he will play and others he will stay out.” Spurs were miraculously denied 3 points against West Ham last weekend. Manuel Lanzini came up with an unbelievable strike to steal a point away from Mourinho’s side. The Portuguese has seemingly not been able to shake the memories as of yet. However, in classic Jose fashion, he has posted an update about his thoughts on his Instagram page. View this post on Instagram 3 balls… The 3 goals we conceded against West Ham?
