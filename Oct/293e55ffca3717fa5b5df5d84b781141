As for Manchester City, they have played one less game than their upcoming opponents, and currently sit down in 14th in the English top-flight, having secured a disappointing 4 points.

(Photo by Harriet Lander/Copa/Getty Images ) Mikel Arteta held his pre-Man City press conference on Thursday. During the presser, the Spaniard discussed a number of topics, one of which surrounded the form of Eddie Nketiah, who earlier this week surpassed Alan Shearer’s England under-21 goalscoring record. As well as impressing for his country, meanwhile, the forward has also enjoyed a solid start to the campaign with Arsenal, notching key goals vs West Ham and Leicester. As such, on Thursday, Arteta was drawn on the possibility of Nketiah becoming a more regular starter for the Gunners, to which the Spaniard responded: “Well, he’s very close because he’s already challenging everybody every week, whether he’s starting or not. I always have no doubts with him because of the way he trains and performs, his goalscoring record is getting better and better every week. “He’s evolving the right way and this is what we need, players challenging and knocking on the door to become starters for us.” See also: Chelsea FC vs Southampton FC betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Manchester City FC vs Arsenal FC betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
