There has always been something special about the talents which are produced and developed in Salzburg. The likes of Sadio Mane, Naby Keita and Dayot Upamecano to name but a few have passed through the exit doors. The latest talent garnering interest is Hungarian international Dominik Szoboszlai. The 19-year-old turns twenty later this month and got an early birthday present of his own making in Salzburg’s opening UCL group stage fixture. What a strike from 19-year-old Dominik Szoboszlai for Salzburg! The dip on that! No goalkeeper would have a chance pic.twitter.com/iPdkJp3i7x — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 21, 2020 The midfielder’s right-footed shot displayed again the youngster’s hammer of a strike he possesses. Similar to the free kick he converted for Hungary from even further out. !

The Salzburg fans socially-distanced in the ground loved the Hungarian’s strike. However, the Austrian side dropped valuable points to Lokomotiv Moscow. A group containing both Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid meant that Salzburg had to win their game against the Russians. Arguably their most favourable game of the 6 at home to Lokomotiv ending in a draw means Salzburg must pick up points to the group’s two favourites. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1205329660-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1205329660-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1205329660-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1205329660-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SALZBURG, AUSTRIA – MARCH 5: supporters of FC Red Bull Salzburg during the Uniqa OeFB Cup match between FC Red Bull Salzburg and LASK at Red Bull Arena on March 5, 2020 in Salzburg, Austria.

If both Bayern and Atleti do indeed pick up wins in both fixtures against the groups lesser teams, Salzburg and Lokomotiv’s tie in Russia would effectively become a play-off. Were Salzburg to drop out of Europe early, it could mean an opportunistic move made for their stars. Notably Szoboszlai and Zambian forward Patson Daka.
