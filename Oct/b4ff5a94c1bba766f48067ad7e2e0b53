The sports lawyer who attempted the purchase of Charlton only a matter of months ago, has now begun a joint-venture with Egyptian businessman Mohamed El Kashashy. The pair have moved to acquire Premier League side Burnley for £200 million. Burnley have had difficulties in several transfer windows and reportedly Sean Dyche has grown frustrated. The lack of signings persisted into the most recent window. Burnley’s only outlay was on Brighton’s Dale Stephens for a £1 million fee. The reluctance to buy has also led to a reluctance to sell. The club lost Jeff Hendrick, Joe Hart, Aaron Lennon and Aiden O’Neill and received no transfer fees. The current Burnley chairman Mike Garlick and the club announced the pandemic has cost the club around £50 million. “It’s a completely unprecedented situation that we and other Premier League clubs face and which we could not have foreseen in anyway only just a few weeks ago,” Garlick said early on during the lockdown. The takeover may provide the club and Dyche the ability to invest and bring in much needed reinforcement to cement their place in England’s top flight. Chris Farnell was handed a ban due to occurrences which arose during a proposed takeover of Charlton Athletic. The ban was appealed by Farnell and he won despite serving a five-week disqualification period. Charlton were eventually purchased by Danish-American businessman Thomas Sandgaard. Since, the club finished the transfer window impressively. By its close, the Addicks had brought in 12 players. A combination of loans and free transfers, however Lee Bowyer will be pleased with the reinforcements. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-107538912-1024x637.jpg?resize=1024%2C637&#038;ssl=1" alt="Charlton Athletic badge" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-107538912-1024x637.jpg?resize=1024%2C637&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-107538912-1024x637.jpg?resize=1024%2C637&#038;ssl=1" alt="Charlton Athletic badge" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-107538912-1024x637.jpg?resize=1024%2C637&#038;ssl=1" alt="Charlton Athletic badge" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 12: A general view of the club crest inside the stadium before the npower League One match between Charlton Athletic and Walsall at The Valley on December 12, 2010 in London, England.

It appears Farnell’s failure to acquire the club has been to the benefit of Charlton and fans will be please after years of animosity towards the ownership. Questions will now be raised if Farnell’s consortium completes the acquisition of Burnley. Known for being extremely well run, could the takeover upset the balance of the club? According to reports, Sean Dyche is central to the proposed new ownership’s plans. With investment, could Dyche take the Turf Moor side even further?
