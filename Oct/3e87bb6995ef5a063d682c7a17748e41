The Premier League returns to our screens this coming Saturday. The most anticipated clash of the weekend pits Liverpool against Everton. As well as this clash seeing two bitter rivals face off, this Merseyside derby also has some added significance due to Everton’s current position in the league. The Toffees have had a superb start to 2020/21 and are currently sitting pretty atop of the English top-flight after picking up maximum points from their first four points. And whilst it is far too early to label Carlo Ancelotti’s side title contenders, picking up a victory over last season’s champions would certainly go a long way to signaling the Blues are on the right track. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228494441.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228494441.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228494441.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228494441.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Everton’s English striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin celebrates after scoring Everton’s first goal during the English Premier League football match between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, on September 13, 2020.

And for the most part, the update was a positive one from an Everton perspective. Ancelotti would confirm that all of Andre Gomes, Allan and Seamus Coleman, barring any last-minute hitches, should be available to face Liverpool. The Italian then offered fairly positive updates on Mason Holgate, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Jarrad Branthwaite – all of whom look to be making good progress in their recoveries: “Andre Gomes is available for Saturday, no problem. “Allan started to train with the team this week. If nothing happens in the next few days he will be available to play against Liverpool. “I think Seamus is going to be good, too, because he started to train with us on Monday. “Holgate and Branthwaite are working individually. Branthwaite is closer [to returning]. “They have no problems [in their recovery programmes] but we have to wait a little bit. “Gbamin is working individually, he is not here [at USM Finch Farm] yet. “I think he is going to be here in 15 days and start to work apart from the team in the beginning, and then with the team. “At the end of the November, I think he can be fit to play.” | Seamus Coleman, Allan and André Gomes are expected to be available for Saturday’s Merseyside derby.
