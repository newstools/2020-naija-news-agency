One of Chelsea’s host of big-money summer signings, Ben Chilwell, has today opened up on the club’s somewhat underwhelming start to the campaign. Ongoings at Stamford Bridge have of course proven one of the talking points of European football over recent months. This comes with the Blues currently in the midst of a remarkable recruitment drive. On the back of a pair of transfer windows without a single signing, Chelsea have since secured 7 high-profile additions. After clinching deals for both Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner before the summer window had even opened, the last week of August saw all of Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva follow suit. The Londoners’ biggest outlay yet, meanwhile, came 4 weeks ago, when the long-anticipated arrival of Kai Havertz was finally made official in a deal worth a rumoured £70 million. And the Chelsea faithful have since also been treated to long overdue reinforcements between the posts, with Edouard Mendy having arrived from Ligue 1 outfit Rennes. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1204153984-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LILLE, FRANCE – FEBRUARY 4: Goalkeeper of Stade Rennais Edouard Mendy during the Ligue 1 match between Lille OSC (LOSC) and Stade Rennais (Rennes) at Stade Pierre Mauroy on February 4, 2020 in Villeneuve d’Ascq near Lille, France.

Frank Lampard’s men have picked up wins in just 2 of their 5 outings across all competitions, and were ousted from the League Cup by capital rivals Tottenham earlier this week. One individual who is certainly not concerned by the Blues’ lack of early-season form, however, is Ben Chilwell. Speaking during his unveiling press conference on Thursday, English international Chilwell was drawn on his new side’s difficulties, with the stopper having been quick to highlight a number of potential explanations: ‘I think it’s the same at all clubs really, there’s been little to no pre-season really. It kind of feels like it’s gone straight from the back of last season into this season.’ ‘Players have come in, Covid isn’t helping things, then injuries, including myself, Hakim, Christian. Key players and new signings haven’t been able to train with the squad as much as we’d like.’ ‘Thiago is new to the building, Edouard is new to the building. So it’s not been easy for us all to bond and gel together, because we’ve not had the opportunity yet. Hopefully, we’ll all get back into training and full fitness in the next few weeks, and that should be positive for us.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
