An insight into Manchester United’s poor treatment of out-of-favour goalkeeper Sergio Romero has been forthcoming online this evening. Argentine international Romero of course acted as the backup to David de Gea at Old Trafford for the last 5 seasons. During this time, the 33-year-old went on to establish himself as, in the eyes of many, the most reliable no.2 in the English top-flight. Romero’s future, however, was thrown up in the air this past summer. After Dean Henderson’s loan stint with Sheffield United came to an end, the highly-regarded shot-stopper returned to Manchester, to battle it out with David de Gea for starting duties. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dean Henderson" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Sheffield United’s English goalkeeper Dean Henderson reacts during the English Premier League football match between Sheffield United and Liverpool at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, northern England on September 28, 2019.

The widespread assumption was therefore that Romero would be on the move, to secure regular football ahead of next summer’s Copa America. Everton, meanwhile, were one of a host of sides tipped as a potential landing spot for the Argentine. Upon the transfer deadline passing two weeks ago, however, Romero remained on United’s books, a situation with which the shot-stopper’s wife made her frustrations crystal clear. And Romero’s woes have since only deepened. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Champions League squad for 2020/21 was announced on the 8th of October, with the veteran having missed out altogether. The United boss’ Premier League panel, meanwhile, was also made official a short time ago. And Romero was once again nowhere to be seen, with Lee Grant instead opted for as the Red Devils’ 3rd-choice between the posts for the season ahead: Our 25-man squad for the 2020/21 #PL season has been submitted…#MUFC — Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 20, 2020 As if blocking a departure, and then essentially ruling out all possible playing time for a loyal long-time servant of the club wasn’t harsh enough on the part of Manchester United, though, an insight into exactly how Romero discovered that he had lost his senior squad berth has also been forthcoming. As per the reliable Rob Dawson of ESPN, the South American was made aware of his omission at the same point as the Reds’ fanbase, via social media. Sergio Romero has been treated pretty poorly by Man United. Not told he was surplus to requirements in the summer, then priced out of a move when he asked to go and was left to find out on social media he had been omitted from CL and PL squads.
