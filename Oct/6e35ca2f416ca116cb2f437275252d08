Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that star midfielder James Rodriguez is set to miss the club’s meeting with Newcastle United. The Toffees will make the trip to St. James’ Park on Sunday afternoon, for their latest Premier League outing. Ancelotti’s men are of course set to head into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, on the back of their first defeat of the campaign last time out. A visit to Southampton last weekend saw Everton deservedly downed by 2 goals to nil. This brought to an end a run of 8 games unbeaten across all competitions, whilst also allowing Merseyside rivals Liverpool to move level with the Toffees atop the Premier League table. Adding further to the woes of the visitors at St. Mary’s, meanwhile, was Lucas Digne’s late dismissal. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1282150966-1024x642.jpg?resize=1024%2C642&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1282150966-1024x642.jpg?resize=1024%2C642&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1282150966-1024x642.jpg?resize=1024%2C642&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1282150966-1024x642.jpg?resize=1024%2C642&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 25: Lucas Digne of Everton fouls Kyle Walker-Peters of Southampton leading to a red card during the Premier League match between Southampton and Everton at St Mary’s Stadium on October 25, 2020 in Southampton, England.

And, as outlined above, the Frenchman is not the only key performer whom Ancelotti will be forced to make do without on Tyneside. Speaking during his pre-Newcastle press conference this afternoon, the Everton boss was asked for a fitness update on his squad. And, after highlighting the absences of the suspended Digne and Richarlison, along with sidelined captain Seamus Coleman, Ancelotti also went on to confirm that James Rodriguez will not be available to feature on Sunday: ‘We have back Jonjoe Kenny and (Jarrad) Branthwaite. James will not be available, and we have (Seamus) Coleman out and Richarlison and Lucas Digne suspended.’ ‘He (Rodriguez) has played all the games. He had a little problem, so he needs to rest for this game and he will be available for the next game.’ | No James Rodriguez or Seamus Coleman, as well as the suspended Richarlison and Lucas Digne, for the trip to @NUFC. Jonjoe Kenny and Jarrad Branthwaite are back available. #NEWEVE Watch live: https://t.co/kdYxKejM5M pic.twitter.com/qk4IybGQwo — Everton (@Everton) October 30, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
