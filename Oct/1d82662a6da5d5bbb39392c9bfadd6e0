She won support from the bulk of member states, including Japan, China, and the EU. Unfortunately, the U.S. government is against her appointment. Because of this, the General Counsel has postponed its announcement of the new Director-General till the 9th of November after the U.S. presidential elections. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala took to her Twitter page to express her gratitude to the WTO for the progression of the Director-General bid and she remains positive about her appointment. She wrote: Happy for the success & continued progress of our @wto DG bid.
