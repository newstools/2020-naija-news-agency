Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has today moved to lavish praise on new teammate Thomas Partey. The major talking point at the Emirates throughout the recently-closed transfer window of course surrounded the club’s chase of reinforcements in the middle of the park. Over the course of the summer, a whole host of midfield stars were linked with a move to north London. Chief among these, over lengthy stretches, meanwhile, were Lyon’s Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid standout Thomas Partey. In the end, having proven frustrated in their pursuit of the former, Arsenal opted to bring in Ghanaian international Partey, to add some much-needed presence to Mikel Arteta’s midfield ranks. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2-1-1024x699.jpg?resize=1024%2C699&#038;ssl=1" alt="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 17: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal talks to Thomas Partey of Arsenal before making his debut during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal at Etihad Stadium on October 17, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Partey’s full debut, during a Europa League meeting with Austrian giants Rapid Wien on Thursday night, saw the former Atletico Madrid man dazzle, en route to Man of the Match honours: Introducing your MOTM tonight… @ThomasPartey22 #UEL pic.twitter.com/u1zNLkaevk — Arsenal (@Arsenal) October 22, 2020 One individual quick to lavish praise on Partey on the back of his display versus Rapid, meanwhile, was David Luiz. Speaking in the aftermath of Arsenal’s comeback victory, the Brazilian stopper explained: ‘He is a great player and I’m so happy he joined us.’ ‘It is a pleasure for me to see players like that, playing off the ball and trying to manage the game. I think he did very well.’ And, as outlined above, another key member of the Gunners’ squad has since followed suit in revealing his admiration for Partey. The player in question? Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. During an interview with Arsenal’s official matchday programme ahead of the club’s meeting with Leicester, Auba was keen to highlight the unique ‘profile’ which his new teammate has introduced to Mikel Arteta’s squad: ‘He has integrated so well in the squad.’ ‘He is kind, calm and smiley. On the pitch, we have seen already seen what he will bring us in matches.’ ‘He is so strong physically but yet so good on the ball as well. We didn’t really have a profile like this in our squad before.’ ‘In terms of ball progression, beating the press, going forward, he will be very important for us.’ The Gunners captain also pointed towards the positive impact he feels Partey is set to have on some of the younger talents currently plying their trade at the Emirates: ‘My family is from Gabon but I also have some roots in Ghana where Thomas is from so we are family too!’ ‘It is good for some of our younger players as well to have a player like him, of his calibre at training. They will learn a lot from him.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
