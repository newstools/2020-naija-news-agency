Billy Gilmour and Fikayo Tomori are both likely to be farmed out on loan by Chelsea this winter, it has been claimed. The major talking point at Stamford Bridge this summer of course proved the influx of high-profile players. On the back of a pair of transfer windows without a single arrival, Chelsea opted to splash the cash this time around, amid a concerted effort to close the gap on the Premier League’s elite. This eventually resulted in 7 stars making their way to southwest London. First up were attackers Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner, deals for whom were actually clinched before the transfer window had even technically opened. All of Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr then followed suit within the space of a week late in August. The Blues’ most pricey addition came in the form of German midfielder Kai Havertz early last month, before long overdue reinforcements between the posts were also forthcoming in the form of Edouard Mendy. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272477171-1024x754.jpg?resize=1024%2C754&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: Kai Havertz of Chelsea runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at American Express Community Stadium on September 14, 2020 in Brighton, England.

The Chelsea boss, in turn, has sanctioned a number of departures to balance the numbers, with all of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley, Malang Sarr and Marco van Ginkel having been farmed out on respective loans. But, as outlined above, if the latest claims in the media this week are to be believed, then the Blues outflux looks far from complete. As per an unnamed agent, speaking to reliable outlet The Athletic regarding recent dealings in the Premier League, another pair of young talents are set to depart Stamford Bridge in January. The players in question? Fikayo Tomori and Billy Gimour: ‘The Carabao Cup is out of the window for the next two months as the rounds have already been played. Fikayo Tomori and Billy Gilmour should go in January.’ Loan moves coming to fruition for either Tomori or Gilmour would come as little surprise, with the former having seemingly slipped down to 4th-choice in the central-defensive pecking order of Frank Lampard, and teenage prodigy Gilmour soon set to return from a lengthy spell on the sidelines.
