An update on the latest ins and outs to and from the England camp has been forthcoming on Monday. The Three Lions are set to return to action with three fixtures over the coming weeks. First up comes a friendly meeting with Wales this coming Thursday. This, though, represents little more than a warmup, ahead of a pair of high-profile competitive fixtures. Both are set to come in the Nations League, as England aim to displace table-toppers Belgium, on the back of an inauspicious start to their Group B campaign. Southgate’s men face a meeting with the in-form Red Devils at Wembley on Sunday. And a 2nd outing in the English capital will follow 3 days later, when the Three Lions take on Denmark. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1154279142.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1154279142.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1154279142.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1154279142.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL – JUNE 06: Head Coach of England Gareth Southgate looks on during the UEFA Nations League Semi-Final match between the Netherlands and England at Estadio D.

A host of regular contributors were, as expected, included, with the likes of Jordan Pickford, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jadon Sancho and Harry Kane all named. There were also first-time call-ups for a trio of stars, with in-form Everton hitman Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Arsenal starlet Bukayo Saka and Leicester wide-man Harvey Barnes all introduced by Southgate. Here is your #ThreeLions squad for this month’s triple-header! — England (@England) October 1, 2020 As outlined above, however, on the back of events over recent days, the Three Lions have today confirmed a number of alterations to their latest panel. First up, Raheem Sterling has been forced to pull out, after picking up an unspecified injury whilst with Manchester City. In turn, Southgate has opted to introduce another first-timer to his squad, in the form of Chelsea stopper Reece James: A first #ThreeLions call-up for @reecejames_24! Congratulations, Reece — England (@England) October 5, 2020 In a separate update, meanwhile, it has also been revealed that all of Ben Chilwell, Jadon Sancho and Tammy Abraham will be delayed in linking up with the rest of their England teammates: ‘As a precaution to understand if there is any risk to the wider group, the arrival of Tammy Abraham, Ben Chilwell and Jadon Sancho will be delayed. This is to allow time to gather further information of a social gathering that all three players reportedly attended over the weekend.’ An insight into the ‘social gathering’ alluded to in England’s statement has also been forthcoming on Monday. As confirmed by the likes of the Sun and more, a surprise birthday party was held for Tammy Abraham on Sunday night. Among the attendees were the Chelsea hitman, Blues teammate Chilwell and Borussia Dortmund wide-man Sancho, with the trio, evidently, having broken Covid-19 social distancing guidelines as a result. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185072798-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185072798-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185072798-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1185072798-1024x692.jpg?resize=1024%2C692&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WATFORD, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 02: Tammy Abraham of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Watford FC and Chelsea FC at Vicarage Road on November 02, 2019 in Watford, United Kingdom. (Photo by Christopher Lee/Getty Images) Speaking earlier today, meanwhile, Abraham, who, in his defence, was completely oblivious regarding his party’s organisation, issued an apology for his actions: ‘I arrived home to find a small surprise gathering.’ ‘Though I was totally unaware this was planned, I would like to wholeheartedly apologise for the naivety shown for the organisation and attending of this gathering.’ ‘All I can do now is learn from it, apologise to everyone and ensure it never happens again.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
