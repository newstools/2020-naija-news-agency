Tottenham are set to return to competitive action on Sunday the 18th of October. Jose Mourinho and co. will welcome West Ham to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a 4:30 pm kick-off. Spurs head into the tie in pretty solid form, with their last outing seeing them put Manchester United to the sword by six goals to nil. They also have a decent record against the Hammers, with Mourinho able to guide the Lilywhites to back-to-back victories over their capital rivals last term. However, West Ham head into Sunday’s game in great form, having seen off Leicester and Wolves in their last two league outings with an aggregate score of 7-0. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1184098346-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 23: Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho looks on ahead of the Premier League match between West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur at London Stadium on November 23, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The Welshman made his long-awaited return to north London last month but is yet to feature this season due to injury. However, it has previously been claimed that the former Real Madrid man is set to make his second Spurs debut against West Ham. But when drawn on the possibility of Bale being involved at the weekend, Jose Mourinho would give little away when speaking to Sky Sports News: “The team is the most important thing, Gary….Gareth is here to help the team but at the same time we care about him, we care about the body. “The decisions we are going to make will be for the good of the team but also for his own good. “It is very, very important he has a happy season with us and I think at this moment in his career that is very, very important.” Mourinho also called Bale ‘Gary’, which may not have been entirely accidental. https://t.co/q3ptM12Kby — Alasdair Gold (@AlasdairGold) October 15, 2020 See also: Chelsea FC vs Southampton FC betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Manchester City FC vs Arsenal FC betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
