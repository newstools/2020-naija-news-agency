Leeds United have this evening taken to social media, to reveal why attackers Rodrigo and Raphinha have both been left out of the club’s squad to take on Leicester City. Marcelo Bielsa’s men return to Premier League action shortly, in a meeting with the Foxes at Elland Road. The matchup comes as a highly-anticipated one, with both sides having been routinely praised for their respective brands of attacking football over the early weeks of the campaign. They will enter Monday’s proceedings separated by just two points, and 4 spots in the English top-flight table. A win for Brendan Rodgers’ visitors would guide them to the dizzying heights of 2nd, behind only Liverpool, on the back of a thoroughly impressive win at Arsenal last time out. Leeds, meanwhile, could finish the day as high as 3rd, with Marcelo Bielsa’s men no doubt brimming with confidence, having downed Aston Villa by 3 goals to nil in their latest outing. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1166155248.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1166155248.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1166155248.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1166155248.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRISTOL, ENGLAND – AUGUST 04:Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa during the Sky Bet Championship match between Bristol City and Leeds United at Ashton Gate on August 04, 2019 in Bristol, England.
