Christoph Freund, director at Red Bull Salzburg, has, on Monday, suggested that Erling Braut Haaland is destined for a move to Premier League champions Liverpool. 20-year-old Haaland has of course established himself as one of world football’s most highly-regarded young talents over the last 18 months. On the back of a scintillating opening to last season on the books of Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg, during which he racked up a staggering 28 goals in 21 appearances across all competitions, a number of Europe’s top clubs inevitably began sniffing around the hitman’s signature. In the end, it was Borussia Dortmund who beat out the competition to clinch a January deal for Haaland, with the attacker having made the move to Signal Iduna Park for a fee of around €20 million. And to say that Haaland has since gone on to repay Dortmund’s faith would be putting it lightly. The youngster has taken to the rigours of Bundesliga football like a duck to water, proving that he is more than capable of cutting it on the big stage. To this point, in 27 appearances for Lucien Favre’s men, Haaland has found the net 24 times. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1201718166-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Erling Haaland" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1201718166-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1201718166-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Erling Haaland" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1201718166-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Erling Haaland" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DORTMUND, GERMANY – FEBRUARY 18: (BILD ZEITUNG OUT) Erling Haaland of Borussia Dortmund celebrates after scoring his team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg match between Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain at Signal Iduna Park on February 18, 2020 in Dortmund, Germany.

And, as outlined above, an insight into exactly where Haaland could end up next has today been forthcoming. Speaking in an interview with Sky90, Christoph Freund, sporting director at Red Bull Salzburg – whom Haaland of course previously lined out for – first provided an insight into how the youngster’s Dortmund switch came about: ‘The talks with Dortmund were short. They told us that they had come to an agreement (with Haaland).’ ‘We didn’t have that much influence on it, but it worked out correctly. Many clubs were interested and got in touch. In the end it was a decision by the player.’ The most noteworthy takeaway from Freund’s interview, though, came later. As Lothar Matthaus rattled off a list of potential landing spots for Haaland, one in particular was singled out. The club in question came in the form of Premier League champions Liverpool, as Freund remarked: ‘There he will land.’ Quotes via German outlet Welt.
