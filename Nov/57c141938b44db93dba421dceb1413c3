Reports in the Italian media over the last 24 hours have linked Juventus with a swoop for Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek. The name of Dutch midfielder van de Beek has of course taken centre stage at Old Trafford of late. Unfortunately for the 23-year-old, however, this does not come for at all the right reasons. Instead, chatter, amongst fans and pundits alike, has largely centered on van de Beek’s struggles for game-time. The gifted midfielder made the big-money move to Manchester United during the summer, and was expected to quickly establish himself as a regular in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s ranks in the middle of the park. To this point, however, this has proven far from the case. Instead, van de Beek has been largely confined to substitute cameos (though he has somewhat surprisingly managed 3 starts in the Champions League). In fact, the 15-time capped international is yet to start a single Premier League fixture for his new club. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272213735-1024x710.jpg" alt="Juventus tipped to swoop for van de Beek/Cristiano Ronaldo set to miss Benevento clash"/> BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 12: Donny van de Beek of Manchester United in action during a pre-season friendly match between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Villa Park on September 12, 2020 in Birmingham, England.

The Dutchman remains widely regarded as a fine talent across Europe, with a host of clubs no doubt ready to strike at the first sign of unrest on van de Beek’s part. And one such club, according to reports, are Juventus. According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, the Serie A champions are keeping a close eye on the situation of the Red Devils midfielder, ahead of a potential swoop. Andrea Pirlo’s side remains in need of one more top-class presence in the middle of the park, with van de Beek having reportedly been eyed up by the Bianconeri prior to his Old Trafford switch. As such, if the Oranje star’s struggles continue as the season progresses, Juve could propose a loan deal containing either an option or obligation to buy. A potential player swap deal is also mooted as part of Calciomercato’s report. In other Bianconeri-related news on Friday evening, meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo will play no part in the club’s next outing. Portuguese attacker Ronaldo has been in scintillating form in Serie A this season, netting 8 times in just 5 appearances. However, as revealed by Andrea Pirlo during a press conference a short time ago, the 35-year-old will not be afforded the opportunity to add to his tally on Saturday, when Juventus make the trip to Benevento: Andrea Pirlo told @JuventusTV: “Cristiano Ronaldo will take an agreed rest session because he was a bit tired after so many games. And it was planned that he would not come to Benevento.”  #CR7 #JUVE — Max Statman (@eMaxStatman) November 27, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
