Arsenal secured Gabriel’s services over the summer. The Brazilian set Arsenal back less than £25m, which looks to have proven one of the bargains of the window so far. Despite being fairly young and having zero experience of the English game, Gabriel took to the Premier League like a fish to water. The former Lille man has already cemented himself as Arsenal’s top central defender and has played a key role in helping Mikel Arteta and co. tighten up what was a previously shaky backline. In fact, after seven game weeks of the season, Arsenal have shipped just seven goals – the lowest of any side currently in the English top-flight. View this post on Instagram Clean sheet + 3 points.

The latest high-profile star to heap praise on the Brazilian is Arsenal legend, Sol Campbell. The former Arsenal stopper stated that Gabriel is making the defenders around him better. Campbell then voiced the opinion that Arsenal ‘stole’ Gabriel for the price they paid for him: “Finally Arsenal have got a centre-back who wants to defend, who likes to defend. “You see Gabriel back there and he is making the players around him better. That is the sign of a top-class player. “He is powerful, quick, strong, good on the ball and good in the air – Arsenal stole him for that price! “That is an absolute steal because he is only going to get better. A very strong player that is only in his 20s. A signing that has hit the ground running straight away.” Quotes via Goal.
