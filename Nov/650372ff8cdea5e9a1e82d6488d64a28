The dismal luck of Spanish champions Real Madrid on the personnel front has continued on Friday. To say that the latest international break came at a bad time would be putting it lightly. Amid an absolutely hectic opening to the campaign, during which clubs across Europe have inevitably seen key players drop like flies with respective muscle problems, those still standing were promptly whisked away to all corners of the globe last week to line out for their respective countries. As such, it has come as a surprise to absolutely no one to see both injuries, and coronavirus cases, continue to mount. The woes of Premier League champions Liverpool have of course been the most widely discussed in the English media, with Jurgen Klopp’s squad having been absolutely ravaged ahead of their meeting with high-flying Leicester this weekend. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 17: (THE SUN OUT, THE SUN ON SUNDAY OUT )Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool collides with Everton’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park on October 17, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

Real Madrid saw first-choice central-defensive pairing Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane both limp off whilst lining out for their respective countries this week. This added to a list of 7 further members of Zinedine Zidane’s squad either in self-isolation following positive Covid-19 tests, sidelined with injuries, or recovering from prior fitness issues. The players in question come in the form of Eden Hazard, Eder Militao, Karim Benzema, Fede Valverde, Dani Carvajal, Alvaro Odriozola and Nacho. And, incredibly, as outlined above, the Blancos’ absentee list has, on Friday, been added to once more. The latest Real star to have picked up a problem? Luka Jovic. As confirmed in a post across the club’s social media platforms a short time ago, Serbian hitman Jovic, who’s time at the Bernabeu since his arrival last summer has proven underwhelming to say the least, has returned a positive coronavirus test. He will therefore miss the La Liga champions’ meeting with Villarreal on Saturday, as Zinedine Zidane’s squad continues to be pushed to its limits.
