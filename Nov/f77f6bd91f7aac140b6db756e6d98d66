Premier League champions Liverpool will receive £2 million in compensation, to cover the cost of sidelined stopper Joe Gomez’s wages for the season, it has been claimed. This past Wednesday of course saw the worst fears of Jurgen Klopp and co. realised. Just days after Trent Alexander-Arnold added to the defensive concerns of the injury-hit Merseysiders, word was forthcoming from the England camp that Gomez had also picked up a problem. Initial reports suggested that the 23-year-old had gone to ground during a training session, with what was described as a ‘potentially serious’ knee injury. In turn, Liverpool’s fans faced an anxious wait for an update on the wellbeing of their star stopper. The news, in the end, though, proved far from positive. In a post across the club’s social media platforms, the Reds confirmed that Gomez was, on Thursday, forced under the knife to repair a damaged tendon in his left knee. Thankfully, he escaped any issues with the surrounding ligaments, though the key takeaway from Liverpool’s announcement was that: ‘No timescale is being placed upon his return, though the issue is likely to rule him out for a significant part of the remainder of 2020-21.’ .@J_Gomez97 has today undergone successful surgery to repair a tendon in his left knee. The issue was isolated to Gomez’s tendon, with no damage to any other associated knee ligaments and Joe will now begin a rehabilitation programme with our medical team — Liverpool FC (@LFC) November 12, 2020 Gomez’s injury could not have come at a worse time for the English champions, with all of the aforementioned Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk and Fabinho currently sidelined, whilst Joel Matip continues to struggle for fitness. As outlined above, though, if the latest word stemming from the English media over the last 24 hours is to be believed, then FIFA are set to do their part to at least somewhat ease the blow of Gomez’s long-term issue. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1066143292-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1066143292-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1066143292-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1066143292-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> PARIS, FRANCE – NOVEMBER 28: Joe Gomez of Liverpool battles for possession with Marco Verratti of Paris Saint-Germain during the UEFA Champions League Group C match between Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool at Parc des Princes on November 28, 2018 in Paris, France.

This is believed to amount to £80,000-per-week, or £2 million for the remainder of the campaign. Further insight into the ‘club protection programme’ is detailed below: England players are covered by the FIFA club protection programme, an insurance package that allows clubs to claim directly via the scheme. The protection covers injuries to players in all A matches, friendlies and training sessions. FIFA will calculate the compensation on a pro rata basis until Gomez is able to restart first-team training.
