Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has this evening revealed why Paul Pogba was omitted from the Manchester United squad to take on West Bromwich Albion. The Red Devils are currently locked in action with Slaven Bilic’s men at Old Trafford. United of course headed into proceedings on the back of an altogether underwhelming opening to the campaign, particularly on the domestic front. Despite having bagged thoroughly impressive Champions League wins over the likes of PSG and RB Leipzig, United had fallen to defeat in 3 of the club’s Premier League outings before today, including embarrassing losses at the hands of Crystal Palace and Tottenham. Such form meant that, ahead of this weekend’s latest round of fixtures, the Reds sat in a lowly 14th in the English top-flight. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1273517650-1024x580.jpg"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 19: Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring their second goal during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on September 19, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Instead, it centered on a surprise absence from the club’s matchday squad. The individual to have missed out? Paul Pogba. Amid an altogether testing period for the Frenchman at Old Trafford, which he himself recently labelled as the ‘most difficult’ of his career, Pogba’s omission this evening quickly resulted in widespread chatter and speculation, hinting at yet another potential issue.

Speaking to MUTV ahead of kick-off in Manchester, the Red Devils boss revealed that Pogba has in fact picked up a minor fitness problem, which saw him ruled out of tonight’s proceedings: ‘Paul’s got a knock in the last game.’ The midfielder’s participation versus Istanbul Basaksehir in midweek, meanwhile, has also been thrown up in the air: ‘He started feeling it yesterday before the session and he couldn’t carry on. Hopefully he’ll be OK for Tuesday but we don’t know.’ Ole Gunnar Solskjaer explains Paul Pogba’s absence vs West Brom https://t.co/7K1p35pya3 — Indy Football (@IndyFootball) November 21, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
