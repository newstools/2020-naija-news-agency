Manchester United’s defeat to Arsenal this evening has seen a number of fascinating statistics surrounding the club’s recent spot-kick fortunes come to the fore online. The Red Devils welcomed Mikel Arteta’s men to Old Trafford a short time ago, for the weekend’s marquee Premier League fixture. The two sides headed into proceedings on the back of altogether disappointing starts to their respective league campaigns, sitting in 13th (Arsenal) and 15th (United) ahead of kick-off. Nevertheless, it was this evening’s hosts who entered the clash as widespread favourites, on the back of a pair of hugely impressive Champions League victories over the last fortnight. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s English Forward Marcus Rashford (R) celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Europa League Group H first-leg football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Manchester United at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on October 20, 2020.

A solitary goal proved all that separated the sides following the 90 minutes, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang slotted home from the penalty spot midway through the 2nd-half. The ensuing 25 minutes saw United go on to rattle the post, piling the pressure on the Gunners in their search for an equaliser. However, Arteta’s men stood firm, knocking back wave after wave of Red Devils attack to cling on for a fully-deserved 3 points. 1 – Manchester United have lost at home against Arsenal in the Premier League for the first time since September 2006, ending an unbeaten home run of 13 games against the Gunners (W8 D5).

The first couple surround the recent woes of not only Manchester United, but Paul Pogba in particular, when it comes to handing opposing sides the chance to net from the penalty spot: 3 – Paul Pogba has conceded three penalties in the Premier League under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, while no other Manchester United player has conceded more than one. Discipline. pic.twitter.com/ZXL2OrWAxp — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 1, 2020 5 – Manchester United have conceded five penalties in their last seven Premier League home games; the previous five penalties they had conceded at Old Trafford in the competition came over a period of 101 games. Punished. pic.twitter.com/7NDit64Wul — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 1, 2020 Elsewhere, match-winner Aubameyang has also taken centre stage in the post-match chatter, with a pair of statistics regarding the contributions of the Arsenal captain also well worth taking note of. First, incredibly, ‘Auba’ today became the first Arsenal player to EVER net a spot-kick at Old Trafford, during a Premier League clash: 1 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the first Arsenal player to score a penalty at Old Trafford in the Premier League, with neither of the previous two attempts being converted (Robin Van Persie in 2011 and Gilberto Silva in 2006). Confidence. pic.twitter.com/aQnuu9Kasd — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 1, 2020 Elsewhere, it was highlighted that: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is only the 2nd player to score in successive PL apps at Old Trafford for Arsenal, after Emmanuel Adebayor (Sep 2006 & Apr 2008) pic.twitter.com/bCOVopj18L — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 1, 2020 Other noteworthy takeaways from the clash include: 4 – Manchester United have failed to win any of their opening four top-flight games at Old Trafford for the first time since 1972-73, a campaign in which they finished 18th. Nightmare. pic.twitter.com/Cx2GAdrfFh — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 1, 2020 The only PL seasons United in which have lost more home games than 2020-21 are 2001-02 & 2013-14.
