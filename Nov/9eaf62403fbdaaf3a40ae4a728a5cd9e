Although the right to peaceful gathering and association is enshrined in Nigeria’s constitution, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the Lagos Police spokesperson, in a statement on Friday said it will not allow any form of gathering, procession or assembly to hold in the state. The Nigerian Government through the Central Bank of Nigeria earlier in the week obtained a court order to freeze the bank accounts of some EndSARS participants and promoters, sparking outrage among citizens.
