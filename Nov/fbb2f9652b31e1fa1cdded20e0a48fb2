Dele Alli endured a rather poor 2019/20 campaign, which saw him struggle to recapture the form he once displayed for both England and Tottenham. This season, meanwhile, Jose Mourinho has very much opted to take the tough love approach with the midfielder. Alli started Spurs’ opening league game of the season vs Everton, but was hooked at half-time as the Lilywhites went on to lose 1-0. The 24-year-old has since been afforded just 21 minutes of Premier League action – coming off the bench vs Manchester United with the result already secured. Alli hasn’t even featured too regularly in Europe, garnering 45 minutes of action vs Antwerp, before being taken off at half-time once again. The week prior, vs LASK, he was afforded just 28 minutes on the pitch. With Alli clearly out of favour under Mourinho, a transfer was, inevitably, heavily touted during the summer. However, no move materialised, though Alli’s game time has not improved. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1191076651-1024x790.jpg"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 30: Dele Alli of Tottenham Hotspur runs with the ball during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and AFC Bournemouth at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on November 30, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

The likes of Mason Mount, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and James Maddison are competing for similar spots with Alli, and right now it is quite clear all would be picked over the exiled Tottenham man. Now, on Thursday, some potential insight into Alli’s future has been provided. The Evening Standard’s Dan Kilpatrick would hold a Tottenham Q&A on Thursday afternoon. During the Q&A Kilpatrick was asked if Mourinho had given up on Alli, a fair question given that the likes of Moussa Sissoko, Giovani Lo Celso, Harry Winks, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Tanguy Ndombele are also seemingly more in favour with the Portuguese. And for those Spurs fans keen on Alli, the response wasn’t exactly great, with Kilpatrick stating that it doesn’t look good for Alli at Spurs and the most likely scenario for the midfielder at the moment is a loan or permanent transfer in January. #thfc The final questions of today’s Q&A are on Mourinho’s favourites in the squad; whether he will pick a fight with the media; and his highlight of the season so far. https://t.co/DoFkr7QLnq — Dan Kilpatrick (@Dan_KP) November 19, 2020 See also: Aston Villa vs Brighton betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Championship betting tips: Gameweek 12 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
