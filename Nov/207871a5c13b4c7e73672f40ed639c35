Updates on the futures of a pair of Chelsea stars have been forthcoming online on Monday. The first surrounds Olivier Giroud. Veteran hitman Giroud has of course endured a less-than-deal opening to the campaign in southwest London. On the back of the summer influx of talent at Stamford Bridge, the former Arsenal man has been reduced to a bit-part role under Frank Lampard. As things stand, both Timo Werner and Tammy Abraham sit firmly ahead of Giroud in Chelsea’s attacking pecking order, as evidenced by his paltry haul of just 36 minutes of Premier League action to this point in the campaign. As such, with the European Championships fast approaching, and Giroud continuing to play an integral role for Didier Deschamps’ France, the 34-year-old’s struggles for game-time at club level have become something of a pressing issue. In fact, just last week, Deschamps urged his side’s star hitman to seek out a move away from the English capital: ‘Olivier Giroud knows it – the situation he’s in today cannot drag on forever. Before March he will have to find another situation than this one.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229658008-1024x621.jpg" alt="Lampard hints Chelsea won’t stand in way of Giroud exit/Ross Barkley tipped for Blues future"/> PARIS, FRANCE-NOVEMBER 17: Olivier Giroud #9 of France celebrates his second goal during the UEFA Nations League group stage match between France and Sweden at Stade de France on November 17, 2020 in Paris, France.

Speaking ahead of his side’s Champions League meeting with Rennes on Tuesday night, the Blues boss first confirmed that, despite being out-of-favour, Giroud remains an ‘important’ member of his squad: ‘Oli is very important in our squad, he’ll always want to play more.’ Significantly, however, Lampard also hinted that, should the experienced attacker seek out a January exit, he will not stand in the way: ‘I want him to be here, but I have a good relationship with him… if he feels differently we’ll have that conversation.’ ‘I saw Oli’s agent’s quotes and I didn’t really think much of them. I understand that he wants to play, but for me it has to be about the strength of the squad. I think he has a big contribution for us.’ Chelsea will not stand in Olivier Giroud’s way in January transfer window, says Frank Lampardhttps://t.co/qj0VeMDjQo — Indy Football (@IndyFootball) November 23, 2020 The 2nd Chelsea star to have seen his name take centre stage in the media on Monday is actually one currently out on loan away from the club – in the form of Ross Barkley. English international Barkley was another to have been affected by the Pensioners’ big-money summer spending spree, eventually resulting in a temporary departure for Aston Villa. And the move, based on the evidence thus far, looks set to prove exactly what was required to kick-start the 26-year-old’s stuttering career. Barkley has gone on to play a central role in the fine campaign being enjoyed by the Claret and Blue, striking up an impressive partnership with fellow midfield star Jack Grealish. To this point, the former Everton man has notched 2 goals and an assist across 6 Premier League appearances. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1281891933-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lampard hints Chelsea won’t stand in way of Giroud exit/Ross Barkley tipped for Blues future"/> BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 23: Ross Barkley of Aston Villa during the Premier League match between Aston Villa and Leeds United at Villa Park on October 23, 2020 in Birmingham, England.

If the latest speculation doing the rounds in the press is to be believed, however, then Dean Smith and co. may not even be afforded such an option. As per a report from 90min, having been thoroughly impressed by his on-loan midfielder’s form over the early weeks of the campaign, Frank Lampard is already taking into consideration where Barkley could fit into his squad in west London next season: ‘Lampard is delighted by how Barkley has responded and has made sure the midfielder is aware that he will be brought back into the fold at Stamford Bridge if he keeps it up.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
