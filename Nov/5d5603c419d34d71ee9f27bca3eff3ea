Former Arsenal captain Martin Keown has revealed his opinion that the (rumoured) training ground bust-up between David Luiz and Dani Ceballos could in fact be indicative of larger issues in Mikel Arteta’s squad. The major talking point on the red half of north London this week of course surrounded widespread reports of a falling out between two of the club’s stars. As first reported by David Ornstein of The Athletic – regarded as highly reliable when it comes to Arsenal news – during a training session last Friday, David Luiz and Dani Ceballos came to blows. It was claimed that, after the latter left Luiz grounded with a dangerous late challenge, the Brazilian responded by striking Ceballos on the nose, leaving a scratch which drew blood: Exclusive: Tensions boiled over in Arsenal training Fri as Luiz hit Ceballos on nose, with scratch drawing blood. When squad returned Tue both apologised + group have continued as normal. #AFC will hope fighting spirit is channeled positively! @TheAthletic https://t.co/7JjNc5eGWh — David Ornstein (@David_Ornstein) November 19, 2020 Ceballos, however, quickly moved to shut down suggestions of issues in the Arsenal camp. Taking to social media on Thursday evening, the Spaniard drew attention to The Athletic’s article, accompanied by the simple caption ‘FAKE’: FAKE https://t.co/QOrbZpXF8J — Daniel Ceballos (@DaniCeballos46) November 19, 2020 Nevertheless, when asked for his take during a press conference on Friday, Mikel Arteta refused to deny that the incident in question had indeed taken place. Instead, the Arsenal boss was keen to assure that there has since been no subsequent fallout within his side’s ranks: ‘Nothing. Training is very competitive and issues happen a lot of the time, but those things get resolved immediately within the team. There’s not much to say.’ ‘No problem at all.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

Speaking to talkSPORT, the Gunners legend first assured that such incidents are not at all uncommon during first-team training sessions. Keown also, though, hinted that the timing of Arsenal’s latest bust-up (on the back of the club’s embarrassing defeat to Aston Villa) could be indicative of a more widespread issue within Mikel Arteta’s squad: ‘If it did happen, it wouldn’t be unusual. These things happen.’ ‘It’s never nice to see it but Arsenal lost that game against Villa heavily and maybe there is a little bit of a problem within the camp and sometimes people get fraught with one another.’ The one-time Arsenal star continued: ‘There’s a fighting spirit there. You won’t want it to happen too often.’ ‘You need to keep everyone together and Arteta needs to be on top of it.’ Quotes via Goal Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
