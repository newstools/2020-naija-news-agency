According to the music veteran, he described the vernacular expression ‘Open Eye’ as the ability of a Nigerian to properly understand and live life like a white man. In his words: "ÒPEN ĚYE" in pidgin English mean say u sabi oyibo thing and u dey live oyibo life. He expressed the negative impacts of the Whiteman-wannabe-syndrome and how it has redefined our priorities individually and collectively by making us slaves mentally to our colonial masters, even though we have independence as a nation. 2Baba expressed: "ÒPEN ĚYE" don wound us plenty.E make us think say London or yanky accent na intelligence. E make us think say our things na inferior. E make generally no like ourselves.#UNWASHTHEBRAINWASH We sabi oyibo tins pass oyibo.African leaders don give up. Them no get ideas again .
