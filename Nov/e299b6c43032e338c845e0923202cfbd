Mesut Ozil has taken to social media, to provide his backing to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, amid the Arsenal captain’s bizarre feud with Toni Kroos. On Wednesday night, quotes attributed to Real Madrid star Kroos began to pique attentions online. Speaking on the German’s personal podcast (as cited by Bild), Kroos launched an unprovoked attack on Arsenal captain Aubameyang. When drawn on the subject of pre-planned goal celebrations, the 30-year-old revealed his bemusement with such actions, before singling ‘Auba’ out for particular criticism: ‘I find it very silly. Even worse is if there are any objects hidden in their socks. Aubameyang once celebrated and took out a mask. That’s where it ends with me.’ Kroos even went as far as to suggest that the Arsenal star’s actions mean that he is does not represent a good role model for youngsters watching the game: ‘I don’t think that’s a good role model, either. What nonsense.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1135835191-1024x731.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Arsenal" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1135835191-1024x731.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1135835191-1024x731.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Arsenal" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1135835191-1024x731.jpg?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Arsenal" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 14: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal dons a Black Panther mask as he celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal with Sead Kolasinac of Arsenal during the UEFA Europa League Round of 16 Second Leg match between Arsenal and Stade Rennais at Emirates Stadium on March 14, 2019 in London, England. (Photo by Alex Morton/Getty Images) Aubameyang, just the latest in a string of fellow professionals to have been on the receiving end of Kroos’ outspokenness, was not prepared to accept the midfielder’s jibe lying down, though. Taking to Twitter last night, the former Dortmund man (who has previously explained the reasoning behind his decision to produce the Black Panther mask during a Gunners win over Rennes in 2019), first questioned whether Kroos has any children. The Gabonese then went on to state that his famous celebration was for the benefit of his son, before assuring that he will not hesitate to produce similar actions in the future: By the wayDoes this @ToniKroos have Kids?Just to remember i did it for my son few Times and i will do it againI wish you have Kids one day and make them happy like this Junior School pupils Talk  and don’t Forget #maskon #staysafe bis https://t.co/J4ZF1XGlsU — Aubameyang P-E (@Aubameyang7) November 12, 2020 And, as outlined above, one of Aubameyang’s teammates in north London has since moved to back the prolific attacker. The player in question? Mesut Ozil. Taking to social media, Gunners outcast Ozil posted a gif of his captain donning the Black Panther mask, accompanied by the simple caption ‘The best goal celebration’.

However, he too has previous with the Real Madrid standout, with Kroos having hit out at Ozil, after the 32-year-old pointed towards racism within Die Mannschaft’s setup, on the back of his international retirement in 2018.
