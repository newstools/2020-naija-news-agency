Real Madrid’s 21-man squad for the club’s upcoming showdown with Shakhtar Donetsk has been unveiled on Sunday evening. Los Blancos are set to return to European action on Tuesday night. Zinedine Zidane’s men will make the trip to Ukraine, for a potentially tricky meeting with Shakhtar. Real will head into proceedings on the back of an altogether mixed spell of form, which has seen the capital giants, particularly domestically, look a shell of their brilliant best. Their last outing, at home to Alaves on Saturday, for example, eventually saw Los Merengues downed by 2 goals to 1, as the champions continue to fall off the early pace set by Atletico Madrid atop the Spanish top-flight. Real’s recent form in the Champions League, on the other hand, has proven more encouraging, with respective victories over Inter Milan having been forthcoming either side of the international break. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture3-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="MILAN, ITALY - NOVEMBER 25: Referee Anthony Taylor is sending of Arturo Vidal of Internazionale with a red card during the UEFA Champions League match between Internazionale v Real Madrid at the San Siro on November 25, 2020 in Milan Italy (Photo by Mattia Ozbot/Soccrates/Getty Images)"/> MILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 25: Referee Anthony Taylor is sending of Arturo Vidal of Internazionale with a red card during the UEFA Champions League match between Internazionale v Real Madrid at the San Siro on November 25, 2020 in Milan Italy (Photo by Mattia Ozbot/Soccrates/Getty Images) In turn, as things stand, Madrid sit 2nd in the Group B table, a point adrift of Borussia Monchengladbach. It is worth noting, though, that the last time Zidane’s men faced Shakhtar, in Tuesday’s reverse fixture last month, the Ukrainian giants departed the Bernabeu with a famous 3-2 win. Whilst of course not an excuse in itself, one key factor behind the hit-and-miss form displayed by Real of late has undoubtedly been the club’s abysmal luck on the injury front. A host of key members of Los Blancos’ squad have spent time on the sidelines of late, resulting in a complete lack of continuity in Zidane’s starting XIs. And, as outlined above, an insight into the current state of the treatment table in the Spanish capital has this evening been forthcoming. This comes after the club’s 21-man squad to take on Shakhtar in 48 hours’ time was revealed. In a boost for the Madrid-based outfit, star striker Karim Benzema has returned to the fray, following a spell out of action. Captain Sergio Ramos, on the other hand, has still not been deemed fit enough to return, whilst Eden Hazard, who limped out of yesterday’s meeting with Alaves, has also been ruled out: Our 21-man squad for the match against @FCShakhtar_eng!#RMUCL| #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/lLwU36p43h — Real Madrid C.F.
