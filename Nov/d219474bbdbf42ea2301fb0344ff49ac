A pair of interesting takeaways from Chelsea’s win over Sheffield United have been forthcoming online this evening. Frank Lampard’s men welcomed the Blades to Stamford Bridge earlier today, for a Premier League clash. Chelsea headed into proceedings with their tails up, on the back of a much-improved spell of form of late. All told, leading into Saturday’s matchup, the Pensioners boasted a 7-match unbeaten streak across all competitions, including wins in their last three. Sheffield United, on the other hand, sat dead bottom of the English top-flight, having notched just a solitary point to this point in the campaign. As such, a comfortable victory for the hosts was widely predicted ahead of kick-off. And, when all was said and done in southwest London, this is precisely what was forthcoming. Goals from all of Tammy Abraham, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Timo Werner eventually saw Chelsea put Chris Wilder’s struggling outfit to the sword by 4 goals to 1. The Blues now sit 3rd in the Premier League table, just a point adrift of joint-table-toppers Southampton and Liverpool. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 07: Thiago Silva of Chelsea celebrates with teammate Ben Chilwell after scoring his team’s third goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on November 07, 2020 in London, England.

The likes of Thiago Silva, Mateo Kovacic and N’Golo Kante thoroughly impressed over the course of the 90 minutes versus Sheffield United. None, though, proved more central to the Blues’ victory than Hakim Ziyech. The Moroccan, who has begun to find his feet over the last couple of weeks since returning from injury, put on a creative masterclass this evening, bagging a pair of assists, as well as playing a key role in setting up Chelsea’s opener. And a statistic, showcased below, to have surfaced in the hours following today’s Stamford Bridge clash, has perfectly illustrated just how impressive Ziyech actually proved from a creative standpoint: 6 & 2 – No player has created more chances in a Premier League game this season than Hakim Ziyech did this evening against Sheffield United (6 chances created & 2 assists).

English international James has established himself as Frank Lampard’s undisputed first-choice right-back over recent weeks, with his superb display on Saturday further justification for this decision. And one individual who has since been keen to single the stopper out for praise is Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness. Former Liverpool star Souness, famously difficult to impress, was drawn on James’ showing versus Sheffield United during the post-match analysis of the Blues’ win. And the Scot went on to reveal his opinion that, despite his tender years, James already cuts the figure of ‘the finished article’. Graeme Souness on Reece James: “He looks like the finished article already…at 20.” #CFC — Simon Johnson (@SJohnsonSport) November 7, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
