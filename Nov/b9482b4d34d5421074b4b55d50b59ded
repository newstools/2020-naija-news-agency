A number of updates on players linked with a move to Old Trafford have been forthcoming online over the last 24 hours. Manchester United have of course endured an altogether hit-and-miss opening to the campaign. The Red Devils, as has so often proven the case over recent years, have dazzled on occasion, including during Champions League wins over the likes of PSG and RB Leipzig last month. However, such performances have been followed by dull, lifeless displays, which paint the picture of a side still in search of a real identity. The low point for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men thus far in 2020/21, meanwhile, came early in October, when former boss Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham ripped the Manchester giants to shreds at Old Trafford, en route to a 6-1 win. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278436178.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 04: Harry Maguire of Manchester United reacts during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on October 04, 2020 in Manchester, England.

And whilst there of course remain a multitude of reasons for the struggles of Solskjaer’s men, from tactics to key players not performing to a lack of discipline, many have nevertheless continued to point the finger towards the club’s recruitment team. United endured another altogether disappointing transfer window this past summer, with moves for a host of high-profile targets having simply not come to fruition. And now, two such stars to have been hotly-tipped for an Old Trafford switch have, whilst on international duty with their respective countries, spoken out regarding their summer links to the Reds. First up is Jadon Sancho. Speaking on the back of England’s friendly victory over the Republic of Ireland last night, wide-man Sancho was asked whether his patchy form to start out the season stems from the speculation linking him with a Manchester United switch over recent months. The 20-year-old, though, was quick to shut down such a suggestion: ‘Nah, I don’t think so.’ ‘I feel like every player has a little dip in their career, and I feel I’m going through that at the moment. It is just how I’m bouncing back and I am just happy to have managers who have faith in and keep sight of me.’ Sancho shuts down talk that @ManUtd speculation affected his form#ITVFootball #MUFC — ITV Football (@itvfootball) November 13, 2020 Next to have discussed the rumours tipping him to link up with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men is Raul Jimenez. At one point during the summer, reports went as far as to claim that Wolves hitman Jimenez was on his on the verge of a move to Manchester, as United went in search of a proven Premier League centre-forward. In the end, though, the Mexican, of course, stayed put, before committing his future to Wolves by putting pen to paper on a new deal. But, speaking in an interview with TUDN this week, Jimenez confirmed that ‘approaches’, on the part of both the Red Devils and Juventus, were forthcoming: ‘One day I woke up and Juventus wanted me, another Manchester United and what I know is that there were approaches made. But an agreement was never reached and nothing was closed. I’m very happy at Wolves.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1191715653-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Raul Jimenez" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1191715653-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1191715653-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Raul Jimenez" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1191715653-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Raul Jimenez" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WOLVERHAMPTON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 04: Raul Jimenez of Wolverhampton Wanderers during the FA Cup Third Round match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester United at Molineux on January 4, 2020 in Wolverhampton, England.

Amid murmurs that Serie A champions Juventus could look to move their star attacker on next summer, United are one club to have been linked with Ronaldo. And, over the last 24 hours, such claims have begun to mount. One outlet have even gone as far as to suggest that negotiations are already underway. As per Portuguese newspaper Record (via Sport Witness), Man United have made contact with Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, to table a formal offer for his services. The Portuguese, in turn, is said to be analysing the proposal, albeit whilst remaining focused on the season ahead with Juventus. Manchester United have made a formal bid to Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent in an attempt to sign the Portugal forward from Juventus.
