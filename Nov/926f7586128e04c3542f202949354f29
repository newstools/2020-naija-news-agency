William Saliba’s situation at Arsenal and the problems he has faced have brought concern to much of the fan base. Having been bought for £27 million in 2019, a lot was expected of the then 18-year-old, with even calls for him to start the 2020/21 campaign. However, an injury-hit season at St-Etienne, where he returned on loan, in combination with Ligue 1’s early close left the Frenchman with little game time and a lack of preparedness for the new season. Therefore, rumours that the club may look to send Saliba out on loan were unsurprising. However, for reasons which are yet unclear, a loan move never materialised. St-Etienne even publicly criticised Arsenal for failing to complete a Deadline Day return loan move. Mikel Arteta has spoken about the regret he has for Saliba’s situation. “I feel really bad for William Saliba,” Arteta said. “Because we had so many central defenders, we decided to leave him out of the squad which was really hurtful for me to do.” “I was hoping that Pablo would be back in two weeks but he had a setback and then we don’t have Pablo and we don’t have William when he’s fit and available to play, but when you make those decisions, you can’t always think about every possible outcome.” With January approaching, Saliba may yet get senior minutes away from Arsenal but any legitimate links are yet to be reported. In the meantime, Saliba has been playing with the under-23 and under-21 squad in both league and cup competitions. Tuesday evening, Arsenal’s under-21 side travelled to Gillingham for a cup match and Saliba partnered the returning Calum Chambers. The Englishman had missed more than 300 days of football with an ACL injury. The game was mixed for the Frenchman and gave some insight into the possible reluctance of Arteta to throw the Frenchman in at this early stage. It should be noted that playing with the youth team may have impacted upon Saliba’s typical style. Having such a a price tag and expectation upon him, the Frenchman’s mentality towards the game and therefore his decision making could have been affected. Surrounded by young burgeoning talent with little to no senior experience, Saliba’s game looked akin to that of a player with the emphasis to be a cut above the rest. Leading to more adventurous passing in an attempt to make things happen. Instances which may not be the case playing for the senior side. Beginning with his distribution, according to Wyscout, Saliba had a 92% pass completion rate. 10% higher than his partner Chambers. He was also forward thinking in his play, completing 82% of the 39 forward passes during the match. However, when playing the ball into the final third, he was less successful. Saliba was often tempted to try the ball over the top when safer options presented themselves and in turn lost possession. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba attempts a lofted ball into the final third when safer options were available and the possession is lost." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba attempts a lofted ball into the final third when safer options were available and the possession is lost." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba attempts a lofted ball into the final third when safer options were available and the possession is lost." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Saliba attempts a lofted ball into the final third when safer options were available and the possession is lost. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A second example of when other safer passing options were available, Saliba opted for the long pass but possession ended up being lost again." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A second example of when other safer passing options were available, Saliba opted for the long pass but possession ended up being lost again." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A second example of when other safer passing options were available, Saliba opted for the long pass but possession ended up being lost again." data-recalc-dims="1" /> A second example of when other safer passing options were available, Saliba opted for the long pass but possession ended up being lost again. Gabriel’s position in Arteta’s team is concrete and Rob Holding would be the more likely for Saliba to look at superseding. However, passing-wise, Holding has shone under Arteta. In the last two Premier League games, Holding had a 97% and 93% completion rate and his pass completion into the final third against Aston Villa and Manchester United was more than doubly accurate compared to the Frenchman’s display at Gillingham. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-5-1024x399.png?resize=1024%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba&#039;s passing into the final third (left) in comparison with Holding&#039;s against Manchester United (right) shows the clear difference.

Holding is typically attempting to feed Hector Bellerin on the right-hand side with progressive accurate passes. Whereas Saliba is trying long balls over the top which fail to reach the target. Arteta requires his centre-halves to be competent with their passing but adventurous, hence his liking of David Luiz. It is possible that the Spaniard’s assessment of Saliba’s passing has raised doubts as to whether he is ready. Before the match against Aston Villa, Arsenal had the best defensive record in the league. Whilst it would be fair to comment that having more men behind the ball has aided this improvement, the defensive performances of Hector Bellerin, Holding, Gabriel and Kieran Tierney have been good. The left-hand side in particular has been greatly improved under Arteta. For Saliba to break into the team, the auditions with the youth side would need to be flawless, and as of yet, they have not been. In the 74th minute against Gillingham, Saliba’s high positioning was exposed with a ball in behind for Dominic Samuel. The Gills’ forward got ahead of Saliba and the Frenchman brought him down as the final man. The referee, fortunately for Saliba, issued a yellow card. In reality, were VAR in play it would have been deemed as a last man challenge, denying a clear goalscoring opportunity and Saliba would have been shown a straight red card. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba is caught high and the Gillingham striker Samuel exploits the space between Saliba and Chambers." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba is caught high and the Gillingham striker Samuel exploits the space between Saliba and Chambers." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Saliba is caught high and the Gillingham striker Samuel exploits the space between Saliba and Chambers." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Saliba is caught high and the Gillingham striker Samuel exploits the space between the two centre-halves. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="In an attempt to win the ball, Saliba fouls Samuel and brings him down just outside the box." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="In an attempt to win the ball, Saliba fouls Samuel and brings him down just outside the box." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="In an attempt to win the ball, Saliba fouls Samuel and brings him down just outside the box." data-recalc-dims="1" /> In an attempt to win the ball, Saliba fouls Samuel and brings him down just outside the box. This rash challenge in a Premier League fixture could be hugely detrimental to the side. Whether this has been consistent in training is, as of yet, unclear but this incident does show some of the raw tendencies many young defenders have. With further coaching this will improve but to chance them occurring in the Premier League is too high a risk at present. However, in other areas Saliba was solid. Aerially, the Frenchman dealt excellently with crosses and attempted long through passes with his height and game management. His composure in tight spaces on the ball was also good and his reading of passes were that of a player beyond his years. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When cutting inside, Saliba reads the Gillingham player&#039;s intentions and positions himself correctly." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When cutting inside, Saliba reads the Gillingham player&#039;s intentions and positions himself correctly." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When cutting inside, Saliba reads the Gillingham player&#039;s intentions and positions himself correctly." data-recalc-dims="1" /> When cutting inside, Saliba reads the Gillingham player’s intentions and positions himself correctly. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When the pass is made, Saliba is able to intercept the ball, recovering possession and breaking down the attack." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When the pass is made, Saliba is able to intercept the ball, recovering possession and breaking down the attack." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="When the pass is made, Saliba is able to intercept the ball, recovering possession and breaking down the attack." data-recalc-dims="1" /> When the pass is made, Saliba is able to intercept the ball, recovering possession and breaking down the attack. There are certainly signs that Arsenal’s investment was well-placed and it may be that Saliba needs to develop specific aspects of his game more in order to earn his first senior call-up. The money behind the purchase will always draw focus and fans will always want to see the new players play. However, it is important that Arsenal better manage Saliba’s situation and throwing him into first team football in his current state and form, could do more harm than good.
