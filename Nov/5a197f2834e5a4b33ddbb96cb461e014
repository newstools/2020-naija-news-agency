Arsenal’s defeat at the hands of Wolves this evening plunged the club even deeper into crisis, with the display of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having perfectly summed up the problems facing Mikel Arteta’s men at present. The Gunners welcomed Wolves to the Emirates a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. Arsenal headed into proceedings in desperate need of all 3 points, having slipped to a lowly 14th in the English top-flight table. This came with the capital outfit’s only win across their last 5 in the league having come at Old Trafford at the beginning of the month. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="No heart, no ideas and no direction: Captain Aubameyang summing up form of sorry Arsenal"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

Wolves took the lead in the clash with 27 minutes on the clock when, just seconds after Leander Dendoncker rattled the crossbar, Pedro Neto slotted home from close range: – “Half the team ran to Pedro Neto – the other half ran to Adama Traore!” The Wolves winger breezes past Kieran Tierney to set up tonight’s opening goal!

Remarkably, this saw the summer arrival at the Emirates move into joint-2nd in the Gunners’ Premier League top-scorer list in 2020/21, despite having notched just 2 goals. Arteta’s men, however, simply couldn’t hold out at the other end, and, just minutes before the interval, Wolves were back in front. A moment of individual magic on the part of Daniel Podence saw the Portuguese attacker take advantage of yet another show of shoddy defending on Arsenal’s part, albeit in admittedly sumptuous fashion: See ya!

With 10 games on the board, the Londoners have now racked up a paltry 13 Premier League points, as the disappointing spell of form being endured by Arteta’s men reaches the point of a genuine crisis. On the back of a 2nd-straight defeat at the Emirates coming to a close tonight, it is understandably difficult to pick out too many positives from an Arsenal perspective. The Gunners, as they have time and time again of late, proved completely flat versus Wolves, with the initial jolt of energy and drive stemming from Mikel Arteta’s appointment having completely evaporated over recent weeks. Arsenal look slow, laboured, and, most significantly of all, completely lacking in ideas as things stand. Whilst it may therefore seem somewhat harsh to attach too much blame to any one player, amid a general team issue, it nevertheless feels only right to draw attention to the recent form of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Gabonese hitman Aubameyang, widely viewed as the north Londoners’ talisman, has looked a shell of his brilliant self of late, following a haul of 22 league goals last time out with just 2 more to this point in the current campaign. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228468270.jpg" alt="No heart, no ideas and no direction: Captain Aubameyang summing up form of sorry Arsenal"/> Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (right) celebrates scoring his side’s third goal of the game with da Silva Willian during the Premier League match at Craven Cottage, London. (Photo by Ben Stanstall/PA Images via Getty Images) The former Dortmund standout’s lack of production, however, has not actually been the most alarming shortcoming across his performances of late. Instead, it has been what can only be described as a complete lack of interest. Let’s remember here, that Aubameyang is Arsenal’s captain. He was chosen by Mikel Arteta as his side’s leader, and is depended on to provide not only goals, but an experienced head to his younger teammates. It is therefore frankly unacceptable to see the 31-year-old moping around the pitch, acting as if he is above the whole situation. Arsenal are in real trouble. A couple more defeats over the weeks to come, and the club’s top-4 hopes could essentially go up in smoke with a 3rd of the season still to play. This is the time for ‘Auba’ to step up, to showcase exactly why the board at the Emirates sanctioned his recent big-money contract extension, and, most of all, to prove himself as more than just a player who shows up when things are easy, and the plaudits are flowing.
