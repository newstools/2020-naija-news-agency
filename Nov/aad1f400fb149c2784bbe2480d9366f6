Name: Eduardo Camavinga Date of birth: Nov 10, 2002 Nationality: France Position: Central midfield Height: 1.82m Eduardo Camavinga is thought by many to be one of Europe’s most exciting players. With a height of 6 foot, the Frenchman is deceivingly fast and agile, beating players with ease. But his abilities as a central midfielder go beyond just that of a tricky player. Competency in and out of possession, timing of passes and tackles, the work ethic to rival any player and the end product of a man well beyond his age. This French star is destined for big things. Camavinga, born in an Angolan refugee camp, moved to France as a young child. In Fougères, Camavinga would join his first professional club Drapeau-Fougères in 2009. Eventually being spotted by the Rennes coaching staff, Camavinga would be invited to the club’s academy. Camavinga, in an interview, told the story of when he was recruited. “I remember it perfectly. It was at Paron Sud. We got smashed then! (0-3, but Rennes would usually win these matches by eight or nine goals) Everyone came to see us. I switched between left-back and centre-back. Since that day, Mathieu wanted me to join Rennes,” he said. “He spoke with my coaches and my parents. And then, he said to me: “Would you be ok to come and do a tournament with Rennes?” I couldn’t believe it. Rennes was a big club. It never made me scared, but I never felt better than others either, never. What followed, was that I played with Rennes and I was taken on. That’s all.” Camavinga went on to become Rennes’ youngest ever professional players, signing with the club just after his 16th birthday. 3 months later, he would make his senior debut becoming the club’s youngest senior player. These records would continue to break as in September of 2020, Camavinga became the youngest French full international at 17 years of age. Not only did the Frenchman play, he scored on his debut. Camavinga se convirtió en el jugador más joven en marcar con Francia desde 1914… Nombra a un jugador con más potencial…#NationsLeague | @equipedefrance pic.twitter.com/YkoczCWNpV — UEFA.com en español (@UEFAcom_es) October 11, 2020 Speaking about his style, Camavinga is quick to reference how hard work is just as important to natural ability. “What I value most is work ethic,” Camavinga said. “I like to do the running for my teammates. If I don’t work hard on the pitch, my mum would drag me off it by me ears. And my dad too.” “Everything they have they have earned by working hard. Even in the toughest moments, they have sweated to make sure we didn’t want for anything. So I see it as logical that now it’s my turn. Now I work hard. In any case, without hard work, I wouldn’t have made it this far.” 101 spoke to Get French Football News writer and all-round French football expert Jeremy Smith “Eduardo Camavinga has already shown the potential to become the best midfielder in the world. What type of midfielder is up to him – he can tackle, he can run all day and he has a great eye for a final ball too. He is a little more comfortable with a more defensively-minded partner alongside him, giving him more freedom to push forward and he will likely fall into a truly central midfield role – but that doesn’t mean he is all graft and physicality – he has the guile as well. He is excellent at finding space, he has great ball control and can work in tight spaces as well as push forward with the ball at his feet, and he has a good set piece delivery and shot on him too. What is most impressive though is his temperament. He has been totally unfazed by his quick rise from Rennes’ first team, to a well-publicised man-of-the-match performance against PSG, to breaking into the France U21 team and finally becoming a full French international in which his first start was marked with a goal through a cleverly improvised overhead kick. His versatility is likely to make him a very important part of the France squad, able to play in a midfield two or three or even in a wider role. Similar to that of a largely upgraded Blaise Matuidi.” Eduardo Camavinga is so talented in many different aspects of the midfield role already. A wonderfully technically gifted player, the Frenchman glides across the pitch and maintains a high work ethic. Tracking back when necessary and with the ability to play as a 6, an 8 or even in a wider birth. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hm-1.png?ssl=1" alt="The heat map from the 2019/20 campaign shows the coverage of the pitch Camavinga works in.

Not favouring a particular side, the Frenchman provides the perfect engine for the team and much more. Camavinga’s pace and elegance on the ball enables him to beat opposition players with ease. Despite his height of 6 foot, he plays as if his centre of gravity is that of a smaller player. Managing to fake players and shift his weight from side to side quickly, making it look simple whereas in reality it is far from it. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Picking up the ball on the left, Camavinga plays a one-two and move into the vacated space.

But with all the technical and dribbling ability, it is nothing without end product. The Frenchman can score and does, on his France debut no less, but his passing is also impressive. Finding cross-field passes which are not simple switches but tactical plays into dangerous positions on the pitch. The key to Camavinga’s game is a consistent want to keep his side on the front foot. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga finds a curling, lofted pass out to the left wing to set up a crossing opportunity." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga finds a curling, lofted pass out to the left wing to set up a crossing opportunity." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga finds a curling, lofted pass out to the left wing to set up a crossing opportunity." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Camavinga finds a curling, lofted pass out to the left wing to set up a crossing opportunity. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A pass from the opposite flank, finding the opposite winger in a threatening position." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A pass from the opposite flank, finding the opposite winger in a threatening position." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-6-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="A pass from the opposite flank, finding the opposite winger in a threatening position." data-recalc-dims="1" /> A pass from the opposite flank, finding the opposite winger in a threatening position. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-5-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="It appears that the Frenchman is able to find passes from almost anywhere on the pitch.

His teammates have learned to trust the youngsters ability to find them and consistently he does. Finally, Camavinga’s work ethic is up there with the hardest of working central midfielders. When out of possession the Frenchman craves possession and is always wanting to recover it for his team. Tracking back, spotting opportunities to tackle and typically winning them also, describing him as the complete midfielder is almost an understatement. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga, second to the ball in this scenario, uses his recovery speed to catch the Nice player." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga, second to the ball in this scenario, uses his recovery speed to catch the Nice player." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-4-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camavinga, second to the ball in this scenario, uses his recovery speed to catch the Nice player." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Camavinga, second to the ball in this scenario, uses his recovery speed to catch the Nice player. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-2-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Overtaking the Nice player, Camavinga then makes the challenge, winning the ball and possession back for Rennes." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-2-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-2-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Overtaking the Nice player, Camavinga then makes the challenge, winning the ball and possession back for Rennes." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-2-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Overtaking the Nice player, Camavinga then makes the challenge, winning the ball and possession back for Rennes." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Overtaking the Nice player, Camavinga then makes the challenge, winning the ball and possession back for Rennes. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Identifying the possibility of a counter attack, Camavinga anticipates the run of the Georgian full-back and moves to intercept." data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Identifying the possibility of a counter attack, Camavinga anticipates the run of the Georgian full-back and moves to intercept." data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Identifying the possibility of a counter attack, Camavinga anticipates the run of the Georgian full-back and moves to intercept." data-recalc-dims="1" /> Identifying the possibility of a counter attack, Camavinga anticipates the run of the Georgian full-back and moves to intercept. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11-1024x576.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="Winning the ball, fairly, the possession falls back to France.

This happening in the 97th minute displays the Frenchman’s commitment and work ethic at any time during the game. Camavinga is truly a special player. His ceiling is limitless from the evidence displayed during the adolescent years of his career. With his technical skill, body structure, stamina, passing quality and work ethic, these all combine to present a player well beyond his years. Even a role model for players not limited to ages below his own but any player. The story of Camavinga is one the entirety of Europe should take great interest in.
