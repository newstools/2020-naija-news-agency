He says, “GOD is a prayer answering God. He longs to hear and answer His people. Call On Me is a song that emphasizes that point. That if there is a people to pray, and that there is God to answer.” Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭33:3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ Credits: Written by Nathaniel Bassey.Produced by Emmanuel Uzozie @juzzypro & Nathaniel BasseyRecorded by Rotimi Akinfenwa @ Song 23 studios Lagos.Video directed by Rotimi Akinfewa.Mixed by John BlassMastered by : Dave HarrisKeyboards : Emmanuel UzozieDrums : Victor Karo AlakpaBass Guitar: Felix JacksonGuitars : OlawaSegun SehindenmiBackground Vocals : Abigail Unwana Bassey, Jumoke Oshoboke, Nathaniel Bassey.Horns arrangement : Nathaniel BasseyTrumpet : Nathaniel BasseyTenor Saxophone : Segun AtoyebiTrombone: Femi Slide Enjoy!
