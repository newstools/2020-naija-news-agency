Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this afternoon provided fitness updates on a number of his side’s stars, ahead of their upcoming meeting with Southampton. The Red Devils are set to return to Premier League action on Sunday afternoon. United will make the trip to St. Mary’s, hoping to keep alive a recent upturn in form. On the back of a pair of defeats, the Manchester giants have since racked up a trio of consecutive wins across all competitions. The latest of these came on Tuesday night, when Solskjaer’s men dazzled en route to a 4-1 Champions League victory over Istanbul Basaksehir, taking firm control of Group H in the process. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1287484707-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man United updates: Mixed news on Pogba, Wan-Bissaka &amp; more ahead of Southampton"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 24: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United looks on as team mate Marcus Rashford of Manchester United prepares to take a penalty, leading to their team’s third goal during the UEFA Champions League Group H stage match between Manchester United and İstanbul Basaksehir at Old Trafford on November 24, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Ralph Hasenhuttl’s men have also thoroughly impressed of late, remaining unbeaten in the club’s last 7 outings. Such fine form sees the Saints sitting 5th in the Premier League table as things stand, 5 places clear of their heavyweight opponents this weekend. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, for obvious reasons, will therefore no doubt be hopeful of having as strong a squad as possible at his disposal for United’s trip to St. Mary’s. As confirmed by the Norwegian this afternoon, however, the Red Devils in fact look set to be without at least two key players. The most likely absentees on Sunday come in the form of Scott McTominay and Paul Pogba, both of whom remain sidelined with respective injury problems: Scott and Paul, they didn’t train this morning. They were not on the grass so they are very unlikely for the weekend. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1169949636-1024x735.jpg" alt="Man United updates: Mixed news on Pogba, Wan-Bissaka &amp; more ahead of Southampton"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – AUGUST 24: Paul Pogba of Manchester United reacts during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on August 24, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom. (Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images) The news on Marcus Rashford, Victor Lindelof and Aaron Wan-Bissaka was more positive, albeit with the trio ‘still not 100 per cent’: Marcus, Victor and Aaron, they came through the session today, so hopefully they should be okay, [if] still not 100 per cent. Finally, on Luke Shaw, Jesse Lingard and Phil Jones, Solskjaer added: Luke has just started his rehab out on the grass, he’s not with the team yet. Jesse’s back from his isolation period so he’s come back with the group and had a couple of days’ training. Apart from that, Phil Jones is still out until probably after Christmas some time.
