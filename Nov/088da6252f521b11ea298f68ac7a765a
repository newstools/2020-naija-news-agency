Dragged in from the cold, Tanguy Ndombele is enjoying regular minutes in Jose Mourinho’s Spurs side. The pair had clashed in the past with the Frenchman even reportedly saying he would ‘never’ play for the Portuguese coach again. However, the impressive performances during the 23-year-old’s renaissance period have seemingly caught the eye of potential suitors. @FabrizioRomano on @podcastherewego: “Barcelona are considering a move for Ndombele  on next summer, but for next January, Tottenham fans can be sure he is not going anywhere.” #THFC #COYS #FCB pic.twitter.com/hA1PjJqmxi — RouteOneFootball (@Route1futbol) November 4, 2020 Barcelona were interested in bringing a central midfielder in during the summer. However, ultimately their financially restricted window failed to bring in the quality they desired. If latest reports are to be trusted, their pursuit of Ndombele could come too late. On Fabrizio Romano’s ‘Here We Go’ podcast the Italian journalist said, “Also Barcelona were interested in him. You know they were looking for a midfielder like Wijnaldum, they were considering a move for Ndombele next summer; at the start of the summer like in June or July. But for January the fans can be sure the player is not going anywhere.” Whilst the arrival of Miralem Pjanic was an addition of top-class quality, the Bosnian’s age (30) leaves little hope he will be the Blaugrana’s long-term option. The sale of Arthur to Juventus sparked much confusion as to the club’s transfer policy. A much younger and well-liked talent, Arthur looked to bring longevity in combination with quality to the Barca midfield. Since the likes of Xavi and Andres Iniesta have since moved on, Barcelona have lacked the technical talent to deploy their passing style bred under Pep Guardiola and previously Johan Cruyff. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-476288632-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="Xavi Barcelona" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-476288632-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-476288632-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="Xavi Barcelona" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-476288632-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="Xavi Barcelona" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BARCELONA, SPAIN – JUNE 07: Xavi Hernandez of FC Barcelona waves during their victory parade after winning the UEFA Champions League Final at the Camp Nou Stadium on June 7, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain.

Also, with Sergio Busquets only 32, the Dutch international has the opportunity to learn from the Barca veteran. Defensively, Barca do seem vulnerable and if the club can sign a technical yet industrious midfielder of Ndombele’s ilk, it could be the catalyst they need to turn the club back to a positive outlook.
