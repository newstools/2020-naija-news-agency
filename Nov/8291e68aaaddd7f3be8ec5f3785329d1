Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 9 is set to get underway on Saturday the 21st of November. The first clash of the weekend pits Newcastle against Chelsea at 12:30 PM UK time. As a result, your team must be locked in by 11:00 AM UK time on Saturday. Gameweek 9 will come to an end on Monday the 23rd of November, when Southampton and Wolves face off. Below are 101’s FPL tips for the upcoming game week. One of the Premier League’s surprise packages this term has most certainly been Aston Villa. Dean Smith’s side head into the current game week 6th in the league, just three points off top spot. One of Villa’s several standout stars this term was been new signing, Ollie Watkins. The striker has hit the ground running in the Premier League, notching an impressive six goals and one assist in seven outings. Villa are now set to face a Brighton side with one of the worst defences in the league this season, which should mean more goals for Watkins. At 6.1, he is also incredibly good value for money. Ollie Watkins has scored  goals in  games in the Premier League this season. Only Dean Saunders  and @DionDublinsDube  have netted more in their first seven appearances for Villa in the competition. pic.twitter.com/UaZMUR9Hm7 — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) November 9, 2020 Leicester and Jamie Vardy have, of course, been in fine form in 2020/21. The Foxes are sitting pretty atop of the Premier League table. Meanwhile, Vardy is the second-best forward on FPL with eight goals and two assists from eight outings. But one of the big reasons you should be signing Vardy this week is because of his opponents. Leicester are taking on Liverpool and though the Reds are normally pretty solid at the back, they will be without all of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and potentially Rhys Williams. With so many regular defenders out, it is hard to see Liverpool being able to contain the pace and power of Vardy and his teammates. Leicester City’s Goal of the Month for October @Vardy7 vs. Arsenal pic.twitter.com/w4wDi6qAtB — Leicester City (@LCFC) November 17, 2020 Everton’s form has dipped off slightly of late, with the Toffees losing three on the bounce. However, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has still been in decent form and should be back to his best in GW9. The reasons for this being that Richarlison should be back, with the Brazilian’s absence having a clear impact on Carlo Ancelotti’s side. And also Everton are taking on newly-promoted Fulham this weekend. Scott Parker’s side have a dismal defensive record with their only win this term coming against fellow strugglers, West Brom. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228494441.jpg"/> Everton’s English striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin celebrates after scoring Everton’s first goal during the English Premier League football match between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, on September 13, 2020.

Virgil van Dijk and Gomez are, of course, expected to miss the majority of 2020/21 so you shouldn’t have them. Alexander-Arnold’s injury isn’t as bad, but he will still be out for a few more weeks and even before that, his returns were not justifying his price-tag – the same can also be said about Robertson. Then, up top, Mohamed Salah is out with Covid-19 and though it is only a small sample size, Sadio Mane generally doesn’t play too well without the Egyptian. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1280730575-1024x688.jpg"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 17: (THE SUN OUT, THE SUN ON SUNDAY OUT )Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool collides with Everton’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the Premier League match between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park on October 17, 2020 in Liverpool, England.

The Wolves hitman has managed to score four goals in eight outings so far this term, a tally that would see them net around 19 goals over a full season. But at the moment, Jimenez simply just isn’t worth your money. The likes of Patrick Bamford, Ollie Watkins, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and even Che Adams are sitting higher on the FPL leaderboard than the Mexican and all come in at a lower price. When Foden was starting matches quite frequently early in the season, there may have been some who believed they had found a great budget buy. However, in recent weeks, Pep Guardiola has opted against handing the midfielder too many chances in the league. In fact, Foden was afforded just 54 minutes of action in City’s last three league ties. Yes, he did impress against Iceland on Wednesday, but signing or keeping Foden is too much of a risk.
