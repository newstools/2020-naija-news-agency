Word stemming from the Spanish media on Friday suggests that Manchester United are readying a fresh move for Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele following the turn of the year. Much of the media chatter surrounding United this past summer of course centered on the club’s pursuit of reinforcements out wide. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was evidently of the opinion that a key factor missing from his side is an out-and-out winger who could add a new dimension of guile and creativity to the Red Devils’ starting XI. Jadon Sancho has long been viewed as United’s no.1 target to fill this role, but, much to the frustration of the club’s fans, a summer deal for the English international simply couldn’t be found. This of course came with Borussia Dortmund continuing to demand a premium sum for their crown jewel. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DORTMUND, GERMANY – DECEMBER 07: Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal which is later disallowed by VAR during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Duesseldorf at Signal Iduna Park on December 07, 2019 in Dortmund, Germany.

A host of alternative targets were subsequently named, with Douglas Costa and Ismaila Sarr just two of those rumoured to have been taken into consideration by the transfer chiefs at Old Trafford. The latter weeks of the window, however, saw another blistering wide-man take centre-stage in the Reds’ winger pursuit. The individual in question? Ousmane Dembele. Fresh off the back of another injury-plagued campaign at the Camp Nou, United were hotly tipped as a potential landing spot for French international Dembele. Some outlets in Spain even went as far as to suggest that a deal to send the 23-year-old to Manchester was on the verge of completion.

As outlined above, though, ahead of the reopening of the transfer window in a little less than two months’ time, fresh speculation has surfaced, linking the former Dortmund man with a move to Old Trafford. The news comes courtesy of Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo. It is claimed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and co. remain on the lookout for reinforcements in attack. Dembele, in turn, has been labelled a ‘priority’, with it reiterated that the Barca star was indeed close to joining Manchester United during the summer. One potential stumbling block in any deal coming to fruition in January, however, is the fact that the Red Devils remain keen on a loan, with option to buy. Barcelona, on the other hand, would rather include a purchase obligation. #mufc are to return for Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembele in January #muzone [Mundo Deportivo] pic.twitter.com/30eoHwMGTc — United Zone (@ManUnitedZone_) November 6, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
