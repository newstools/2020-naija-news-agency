Concerns surrounding the fitness of Chelsea star Timo Werner have today subsided, after the German was pictured back in first-team training. The Blues are set to return to action on Saturday afternoon, with a trip to St. James’ Park. Chelsea will of course head into proceedings hoping to carry on from where the club left off prior to the international break. Lampard’s men have not fallen to defeat since the back end of September, a run of 8 outings across all competitions. This includes a stretch of 4 consecutive wins, and clean sheets in 5 of their last 6 fixtures. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 07: Thiago Silva of Chelsea celebrates with teammate Ben Chilwell after scoring his team’s third goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on November 07, 2020 in London, England.

As such, on paper at least, it appears almost a foregone conclusion that Chelsea should cruise to their latest 3-point haul on Tyneside tomorrow afternoon. The issue for the Blues, though, has been the international break. As well as interrupting the club’s rhythm just when it appeared as though Frank Lampard had unearthed the ideal winning formula at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have also been forced to deal with a number of personnel concerns over the last couple of weeks. Speaking during a press conference on Thursday, the Pensioners boss confirmed that, as things stand, all of Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Thiago Silva look set to miss out versus Newcastle. Ben Chilwell’s potential participation, meanwhile, also remains up in the air. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1285831145-1024x683.jpg"/> HEVERLEE, BELGIUM – NOVEMBER 15: Ben Chilwell of England receives medical treatment during the UEFA Nations League group stage match between Belgium and England at King Power at Den Dreef Stadion on November 15, 2020 in Heverlee, Belgium.

The prolific hitman is fresh off the back of a testing couple of weeks with the German national side. As outlined above, though, any doubts surrounding Werner’s wellbeing ahead of the Blues’ trip to St. James’ have this evening been quelled. Taking to the club’s social media platforms to reassure their fans, Chelsea posted a series of photos of their big-money summer signing in training, alongside the rest of Frank Lampard’s squad: ‘Werner pics admin?’ A thread. pic.twitter.com/AaTD9AZUHl — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) November 20, 2020 ‘where the heck is Werner’ pic.twitter.com/0K4AysDX8e — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) November 20, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
