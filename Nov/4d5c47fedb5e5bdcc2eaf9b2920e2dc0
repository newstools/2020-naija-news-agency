One of the more bizarre stories of the international break thus far has continued to develop online on Thursday. The story in question surrounds Toni Kroos and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. On Wednesday night, quotes attributed to Real Madrid star Kroos began to pique attentions. Speaking on the German’s personal podcast (as cited by Bild), Kroos launched an unprovoked attack on Arsenal captain Aubameyang. When drawn on the subject of pre-planned goal celebrations, the 30-year-old revealed his bemusement with such actions, before singling ‘Auba’ out for particular criticism: ‘I find it very silly. Even worse is if there are any objects hidden in their socks. Aubameyang once celebrated and took out a mask. That’s where it ends with me.’ Kroos even went as far as to suggest that the Arsenal star’s actions mean that he is does not represent a good role model for youngsters watching the game: ‘I don’t think that’s a good role model, either. What nonsense.’ This is far from the first time that Kroos has revealed his outspoken nature when it comes to the actions and opinions of fellow professionals, having previously had choice words for both Mesut Ozil and Leroy Sane. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1137783433-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1137783433-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1137783433-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1137783433-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS – MARCH 23: Toni Kroos of Germany speaks to the media during a press conference ahead of their UEFA European Championship Qualifier match against the Netherlands at Johan Cruyff Arena on March 23, 2019 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

First, after coming across an article centering on the German international’s latest comments, Auba questioned whether the quotes were legitimate, unsurprisingly taken aback by the situation: Hmm i want to answer but First @ToniKroos i just want to be sure if it was really you? — Aubameyang P-E (@Aubameyang7) November 12, 2020 And the Gunners hitman, upon discovering that Kroos was indeed the man behind the quotes in question, has since taken to his personal Twitter account, to post a follow-up Tweet. Aubameyang (who has previously explained the reasoning behind his decision to produce the Black Panther mask during a Gunners win over Rennes in 2019), first questioned whether the Real Madrid mainstay has any children. To be clear, Kroos has 3 children. The Gabonese then went on to state that his famous celebration was for the benefit of his son, before assuring that he will not hesitate to produce similar actions in the future: By the wayDoes this @ToniKroos have Kids?Just to remember i did it for my son few Times and i will do it againI wish you have Kids one day and make them happy like this Junior School pupils Talk  and don’t Forget #maskon #staysafe bis https://t.co/J4ZF1XGlsU — Aubameyang P-E (@Aubameyang7) November 12, 2020 Arsenal’s Szoboszlai deal not advanced, Zouma close to new contract & Liverpool defensive target going elsewhere Tactical Insight: William Saliba – The evidence as to why Mikel Arteta is not yet ready to throw the Frenchman into the Arsenal first team Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
