Manchester United return to European action on Wednesday evening. The Red Devils will play host to PSG, in their penultimate Champions League group game of the season. United head into the clash sitting pretty atop Group H, three points clear of 2nd-placed PSG and 3rd-placed RB Leipzig. As such, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men set to face both sides in their final two outings, they require just a single point to ensure qualification for the knockout rounds. Despite having downed PSG and Leipzig in impressive fashion in the reverse fixtures, though, the Manchester giants will be well aware that securing even a point against two sides fighting for their European seasons will prove no easy task. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg" alt="Thomas Tuchel provides update on PSG trio ahead of Man United"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JANUARY 22: Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of Manchester United walks off at half time during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Burnley FC at Old Trafford on January 22, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

Before taking on Manchester United, PSG faced off with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Saturday evening. And, despite heading into proceedings as heavy favourites, the Parisians were eventually held to a 2-2 draw. Following the full-time whistle in the French capital, meanwhile, Tuchel held his post-match press conference, during which the PSG boss provided updates on the fitness of a number of his side’s stars. All of Keylor Navas, Marquinhos and Layvin Kurzawa missed out on Saturday’s draw in Paris. And when quizzed on the trio’s potential involvement vs United, Tuchel had the following to say: “If they will be 100% in Manchester? What is 100%? Today I would say yes. There are more doubts for Layvin Kurzawa. But for Marquinhos and Keylor, they have to play. How? ‘Or’ What ? I don’t know … But we will see with the physiotherapists, the doctors … We must absolutely have both, if possible all three.” See also: Leicester City vs Fulham betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds West Ham vs Aston Villa betting tips: Premier League preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
