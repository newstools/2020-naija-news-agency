The song delivered in Pidgin and a dash of Yoruba languages acknowledges a story of love, affluence, and choices -where a man who loves a woman is not the one that gets her because love sometimes is compromised for the comfort of affluence.FayRoss is a uniquely gifted artist who also models and acts in his spare time. Race is his first single after his sign up to 1A1V Music. He seeks to carve a niche for himself with his infectious Afrobeat and pop-infused style within the African music industry.The single promises to morph into a monster hit as major media houses around the world have shown excitement towards his 1A1V Music sign up and Morgan Heritage affiliation. In partnership with 1A1V Music, the Grammy Award-winning group label and home to Morgan Heritage, ‘CTBC Nation’ looks to solidify FayRoss as one of the iconic stars rising from the shores of Africa.
