Arsenal’s academy side secured a hard-fought victory over Everton this afternoon, with a number of noteworthy takeaways from the clash having been forthcoming. Steve Bould’s men welcomed the Toffees to the Emirates a short time ago, for their latest Premier League 2 outing. The hosts headed into proceedings aiming to build on a morale-boosting win last time out. On the back of an abysmal opening to the campaign, which had seen the Gunners pick up just 2 points from their opening 7 outings, Arsenal exploded into life two weeks ago, to down Blackburn Rovers by 6 goals to nil. And, when all was said and done on Friday afternoon, the capital giants made it two wins from two, to continue their ascent away from the bottom of the Premier League 2 table. A tightly-contested affair in north London eventually saw a solitary goal prove the difference between the sides. Emile Smith-Rowe was the man on target, slotting home from Ben Cottrell’s delivery inside the opening 10 minutes, to secure all 3 points for a resurgent Arsenal side.

The first surrounds the form of youngster Emile Smith-Rowe. Attacking midfielder Smith-Rowe has looked superb at youth level of late, and made it 3 goals in his last 2 appearances for Steve Bould’s U23s with his match-winning strike on Friday. Having previously impressed during fleeting appearances at senior level, too, a recall to Mikel Arteta’s first-team ranks over the weeks ahead could well be on the cards, with Smith-Rowe a potential answer to the creative woes of the north Londoners in the middle of the park. Elsewhere, highly-regarded hitman Folarin Balogun, who recently made his senior Arsenal bow during a Europa League meeting with Dundalk, was given his marching orders versus Everton. After picking up a booking for punching the ball away, the 19-year-old was soon sent for an early bath, having been deemed guilty of simulation. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1210200660-1024x709.jpg"/> BOREHAMWOOD, ENGLAND – MARCH 03: Flo Balogun celebrates scoring his 2nd goal, Arsenal’s 4th, during the Premier League International Cup match between Arsenal FC and AS Monaco FC at Meadow Park on March 03, 2020 in Borehamwood, England.

A trio of high-profile stoppers – William Saliba, Calum Chambers and Sokratis Papastathopoulos – took their place in Bould’s defence versus Everton, and went on to play a key role in the Gunners’ clean sheet. #AFCU23 team news is in! #PL2  pic.twitter.com/irWiBsAcAU — Arsenal Academy (@ArsenalAcademy) November 20, 2020 Despite all three, for different reasons, not considered as part of the first-team picture in north London as things stand, it is worth remembering that, in combined transfer fees, Saliba, Chambers and Sokratis set Arsenal back a combined £60 million.
