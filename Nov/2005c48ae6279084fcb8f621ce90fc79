The agency who represent Manchester United defender Eric Bailly have this weekend hinted that, should more opportunities not be forthcoming for the stopper, he will soon be forced to weigh up an exit. The opening months of the new season have, all told, summed up Ivorian international Bailly’s Man United stint. The 26-year-old, when handed the opportunity to impress, has looked largely solid, with a standout League Cup showing at Luton back in September a particular highlight. Every time it appears as though Bailly’s career in Manchester is finally set to take off, though, one of a high-profile mistake, or a fitness problem (generally the latter), is swiftly forthcoming. Injury woes have once again plagued the former Villarreal man in 2020/21, with the latest in a string of muscle issues having seen Bailly ruled out for a month late in October. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228657646-1024x709.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228657646-1024x709.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228657646-1024x709.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1228657646-1024x709.jpg?resize=1024%2C709&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Eric Bailly (left) and Luton Town’s George Moncur during the Carabao Cup third round match at Kenilworth Road, Luton.

With the addition of another central-defensive option having already been touted as the no.1 target for the board at Old Trafford next summer, though, it does not appear as though opportunities are likely to increase for Bailly any time soon. As such, with the African possessing undoubted talent, questions will inevitably soon be asked of his Manchester United future. And, as outlined above, if the latest comments on the part of his agents are anything to go by, then Bailly could very well soon seek out a new home. Speaking in an interview with Calciomercato this weekend, Graziano Battistini, head of Promoesport (Bailly’s representative agency), confirmed that, though his client remains happy in Manchester, if an upturn in game-time is not forthcoming, the 26-year-old’s situation ‘will need to be assessed’: ‘The experience with the Red Devils depends, as always, on luck, who you meet, on the opportunities.’ ‘If he has the right chances, for me he can be an important player to solve some problems of the team.’ ‘If all this does not happen, it is clear that the situation will need to be assessed, but now it is too early to say certain things.’ ‘My Spanish partners who manage him are cautious in all respects, but the boy is very focused on Manchester United.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
