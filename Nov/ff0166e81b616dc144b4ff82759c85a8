Gregg Berhalter, United States national team manager, has today provided Chelsea’s fans with a brief update on the wellbeing of Christian Pulisic. Frank Lampard’s in-form Blues of course kept their fine recent stretch alive this past weekend, in a meeting with Sheffield United. Chelsea welcomed Chris Wilder’s men to Stamford Bridge, for the club’s latest Premier League outing. And, when all was said and done in the English capital, the hosts made it four wins from their last four, courtesy of a dominant 4-1 result. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284439572-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 07: Thiago Silva of Chelsea celebrates with teammate Ben Chilwell after scoring his team’s third goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge on November 07, 2020 in London, England.

One key member of Lampard’s frontline to have missed out versus the Blades, however, was Christian Pulisic. 22-year-old Pulisic has now played no part in any of his side’s last 3 outings, after picking up a hamstring injury during the warmup prior to Chelsea’s meeting with Burnley two weekends ago. In his latest update prior to the Londoners’ win over Sheffield United, meanwhile, Frank Lampard had the following to say regarding the fitness of the former Dortmund man: ‘Not fit to play, still suffering with his hamstring.’ ‘He trained at a low level in midweek and wasn’t comfortable. We have to keep looking for the right solution.’ As such, it had since remained altogether unclear exactly when Pulisic is likely to return to the pitch. As outlined above, though, a further update on the situation has, on Monday evening, been forthcoming. And, if accurate, it appears likely that the goalscoring wide-man should be available for selection for Chelsea’s next outing – a trip to St. James’ Park following the international break. Speaking in a press conference today, USA boss Gregg Berhalter was asked for the latest on Pulisic’s fitness, with the 22-year-old, despite his recent hamstring problem, having opted to link up with his country’s squad this week. And Berhalter went on to confirm that, as things stand, Pulisic is viewed as ‘day-to-day’, suggesting he is just waiting for the all-clear to make a full return to the pitch: ‘Christian is in camp and is listed as day-to-day. It says a lot about Christian that he wasn’t playing for Chelsea but wanted to come into this camp and be around the team. His status is day-to-day.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-1186519130-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 09: Christian Pulisic of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on November 09, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images) On Pulisic’s struggles to maintain full fitness since his arrival in England, Berhalter added: ‘I really see it as a young player who is just adapting to the demands of a different game, a different schedule.’ ‘When you get injured, when you have a muscle injury, it takes you a while to get fully fit and recover and this is part of his recovery process.’ ‘I have no doubt that he’s going to be a player that is fit for a very long period of time when he gets through this period.’ Pulisic’s problems New signings rated Silva’s headaches https://t.co/oYQ4ngtbP5 — football.london (@Football_LDN) November 10, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
