One of the most high-profile Premier League deadline day moves, of course, saw Arsenal clinch the services of Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid. The midfielder had been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates throughout the summer. However, when deadline day rolled around, no move had been agreed. Reports even began to spread suggesting that Partey looked altogether unlikely to make the move to the Emirates. But, as the final moments of the transfer window came to pass, news was finally forthcoming that the Gunners had completed a move for the Ghana international. Partey has since hit the ground running at the Emirates, putting on some starring displays both domestically and in Europe. The midfielder also played a key role in the Gunners’ ending their dismal away record vs the ‘big six’ when they downed Manchester United at the beginning of the month. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture1-1024x687.jpg?resize=1024%2C687&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture1-1024x687.jpg?resize=1024%2C687&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture1-1024x687.jpg?resize=1024%2C687&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture1-1024x687.jpg?resize=1024%2C687&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 01: Thomas Partey of Arsenal is challenged by Paul Pogba of Manchester United during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford on November 01, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Arsenal, of course, have had countless top quality midfielders down the years such as Patrick Viera, Emmanuel Petit and Gilberto Silva. However, it was actually a Chelsea legend whom Partey has named as his idol. Said player is Michael Essien, who spent nine years honing his craft at Stamford Bridge. When speaking about Essien recently, Partey stated: “He’s a fantastic midfielder. He fights for every ball, he’s a great legend. For me, he’s one of the best midfielders that we’ve ever had in Africa. “I think we’ve all seen what he has done at Chelsea, what he has done for the Black Stars and for me, he’s my idol. “I grew up watching Michael Essien, Muntari, the Ayew brothers – they are the people I look up to and they made a lot of impact on Ghanaians. I think this is my moment and I have to make sure I take it.” Quotes via Arsenal’s official website.
