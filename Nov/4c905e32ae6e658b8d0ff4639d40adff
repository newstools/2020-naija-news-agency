The latest word stemming from the European media on Tuesday suggests that Arsenal are laying the groundwork for an imminent swoop for Red Bull Salzburg standout Dominik Szoboszlai. The major talking point at the Emirates throughout the latest transfer window of course surrounded the club’s chase of reinforcements in the middle of the park. Over the course of the summer, a whole host of midfield stars were linked with a move to north London. Chief among these, over lengthy stretches, were Lyon’s Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid standout Thomas Partey. In the end, having proven frustrated in their pursuit of the former, Arsenal opted to bring in Ghanaian international Partey, to add some much-needed presence to Mikel Arteta’s midfield ranks. And the 27-year-old has certainly not taken long in making his presence felt, bagging Man of the Match honours in his full Gunners debut versus Rapid Wien, before driving his new side to a long overdue win at Old Trafford two weeks ago. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229401319.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal’s Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey (L) vies with Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba (R) during the English Premier League football match between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford in Manchester, north west England, on November 1, 2020.

Recent weeks have seen the complete lack of a creative spark at Mikel Arteta’s disposal (as Mesut Ozil remains frozen out) widely highlighted, with a midfielder capable of both setting up teammates and finding the back of the net himself expected to be next on the Gunners’ wishlist. Aforementioned summer target Aouar of course remains one option, though the Frenchman’s difficult start to the campaign, coupled with a likely hefty price-tag, could see Arteta and co. look elsewhere. And, as outlined above, a move for one such alternative target already appears to be in the making. The player being lined up? Dominik Szoboszlai. RB Salzburg talent Szoboszlai has long been regarded as one of European football’s most gifted young creators, with his displays over the early weeks of the new season having done little to suggest otherwise. ¿Verás hoy algún gol mejor que este?

As per the Gazzetta dello Sport (via Sport Witness), the north Londoners are in consistent talks with Szoboszlai’s agent, regarding a potential transfer. It is not clear whether such a swoop could come in January or next summer, though one thing which does appear certain is that Arsenal will not have a clear path to the 20-year-old’s signing. A number of other clubs, chiefly AC Milan, are also said to be eyeing Szoboszlai. This comes with the goalscoring midfielder’s contract at Salzburg reported to possess a release clause of just €25 million.
