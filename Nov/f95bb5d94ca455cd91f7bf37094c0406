Isco has been on Real’s books for just over seven years now, since joining from Malaga in the summer of 2013. The Spaniard has gone on to enjoy a trophy-laden stint at the Bernabeu, bagging four Champions Leagues and two league titles along the way. However, despite arguably being in his prime years at present, the 28-year-old has fallen somewhat out of favour under Zinedine Zidane. The midfielder was in and out of Los Blancos’ starting XI for much of the 2019/20 campaign, and rarely completed 90 minutes in La Liga. Just a couple of months into the new season, meanwhile, Isco’s woes have continued. The Spanish international has managed six La Liga appearances thus far, in which he has failed to complete 90 minutes once. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195213434-1024x746.jpg"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 21: Carlo Ancelotti, Manager of Everton is seen in the stands prior to the Premier League match between Everton FC and Arsenal FC at Goodison Park on December 21, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

It was even claimed recently that Isco is keen to link up with former boss Carlo Ancelotti, and former teammate James Rodriguez, at Everton. And the prospect of having both Isco and Rodriguez in the same starting eleven would no doubt excite the Everton faithful. However, Carlo Ancelotti has recently spoken out over these links in a less than PG manor. When drawn on his side’s reported interest in Isco by DIRECTV Sports Co recently, the Italian went on to state that Everton haven’t started thinking about January yet and the comments are ‘bullsh*t: “It is not true that I am behind Isco. “We haven’t started thinking about the team for the January market. So those comments are, as they say here, bullsh*t.” Quotes via Goal.
