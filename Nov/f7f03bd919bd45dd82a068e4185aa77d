A sneak peek at the colour scheme of Chelsea’s home kit for next season has surfaced online on Sunday. Premier League giants Chelsea have of course long donned a simply blue and white jersey at Stamford Bridge. Whilst sponsors and designs have come and gone in seasons gone by, the Pensioners have not strayed from their traditional home colours since the 2012/13 campaign. 8 years ago, whilst the club’s current manager was still lining out as a player in southwest London, Chelsea’s blue was accompanied by gold stripes, along with a gold-coloured ‘Samsung’ sponsor. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-849242508-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-849242508-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-849242508-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-849242508-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chelsea’s Frank Lampard runs with the ball in front of his manager Rafael Benitez (Photo by Sean Dempsey/PA Images via Getty Images) This of course marks a far cry from the current look of the capital giants, a simple all-over blue, fronted by a large 3 symbol. If the first photos of Chelsea’s 2021/22 getup are anything to go by, though, then it appears that a shakeup may be in store for fans of the Blues. As revealed by the reliable Footy Headlines, the next home kit set to be donned by Lampard’s men will see a contrast of colours, as more than a subtle hint of yellow is introduced. The club’s Nike tick is one aspect set to change from white to yellow, though it remains unclear exactly which other elements of the Chelsea kit will follow suit: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-jersey-1024x519.png?resize=1024%2C519&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-jersey-1024x519.png?resize=1024%2C519&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-jersey-1024x519.png?resize=1024%2C519&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-jersey-1024x519.png?resize=1024%2C519&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Further hints of the imminent yellow introduction are also seen in leaked photos of the Premier League giants’ upcoming 2021/22 polo shirts and peaked caps: <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-polo-1024x817.png?resize=1024%2C817&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-polo-1024x817.png?resize=1024%2C817&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-polo-1024x817.png?resize=1024%2C817&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-polo-1024x817.png?resize=1024%2C817&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-hat-1024x600.png?resize=1024%2C600&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-hat-1024x600.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-hat-1024x600.png?resize=1024%2C600&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chelsea-hat-1024x600.png?resize=1024%2C600&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Confimed: Nike Chelsea 21-22 Home Kit Colors Leaked: https://t.co/aT3Bt8GYzb — Footy Headlines (@Footy_Headlines) November 8, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
