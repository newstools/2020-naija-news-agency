Tottenham Hotspur have found themselves joint top of their Europa league group after two wins and a defeat, level with both LASK and Antwerp. The 1-0 loss to the Belgian side has meant that Jose Mourinho may be forced into a stronger team selection than he may have liked ahead of the top of the table clash with Chelsea at the weekend. Chelsea were able to rest a number of their first team squad as they qualified for the knockout stages with a 2-1 win in France against Rennes. Mourinho was asked in his pre-match press conference if his selection would be a strong one considering their position in the gorup. “Every game in the Premier League is important and since the moment that we were in the Europa League we knew we were to always play on the Thursday,” said the Portuguese coach. “In the Champions League they have the option of the Tuesday or Wednesday and in that case they were lucky this week that the draw gave them a Tuesday match that will allow them to prepare for the match on Sunday. Eventually I don’t know if they gave them a day off but plenty of time to work.” “The next match is not even Chelsea, it’s Ludogorets and we of course already have a defeat in the group stage and we need to win the match tomorrow. We have to focus on that match and then after that we will focus on Chelsea.” Chelsea will have significant time to rest however did travel abroad for their Tuesday night tie whereas Spurs are hosting the Bulgarian club. The injury to Toby Alderweireld was a huge blow to Spurs and Mourinho who have looked defensively astute. Joe Rodon was brought on in place of the Belgian to see out the game against Manchester City. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1196144549-1024x682.jpg" alt="Mourinho refuses to be drawn into selection reveal with Ludogorets selection puzzle ahead of huge Chelsea clash"/> STOKE-ON-TRENT, ENGLAND – JANUARY 25: Joe Rodon of Swansea City applauds the fans at the final whistle during the Sky Bet Championship match between Stoke City and Swansea City at the Bet 365 Stadium on January 25, 2020 in Stoke-on-Trent, England.

Of course the accumulation of matches is a problem. The Toby injury has a relation with an accumulation of minutes. It’s also about players that work a lot. They’re not starting matches and they deserve to start. Ben Davies has to start. He didn’t play Sunday, he plays tomorrow. Just as an example, good players, good professionals. Working very hard for the team. I consider them first options. So between Sergio and Ben, they are first options. So of course after Sergio played on Sunday it’s normal that Ben is going to play tomorrow.” Spurs travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday at 4:30pm to face Chelsea to remain top of the table.
