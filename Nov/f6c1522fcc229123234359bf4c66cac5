Angel Gomes’ latest starring performance for Boavista this past weekend has seen the ex-Manchester United man’s stock continue to rise. Gomes, a 20-year-old attacking midfielder, is a product of the Red Devils’ academy. During the English youth international’s time making his way through the ranks at Old Trafford, Gomes established himself as one of the most highly-regarded talents on United’s books. This was evidenced by the fact that he became the Manchester giants’ youngest senior debutant in 60 years, when lining out versus Crystal Palace in 2017, at the age of just 16. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686349002-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" alt="Angel Gomes" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686349002-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686349002-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" alt="Angel Gomes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686349002-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" alt="Angel Gomes" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – MAY 21: Angel Gomes of Manchester United comes on for Wayne Rooney of Manchester United during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on May 21, 2017 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Dave Thompson/Getty Images) Unfortunately for Gomes, however, the years following his record-breaking United bow saw the starlet largely struggle for opportunities. While the likes of Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood, both younger than Gomes, carved out regular minutes for themselves under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the diminutive midfielder was not deemed worthy of the same kind of chances. And this lack of game-time, in turn, saw Gomes come to the eventual decision to move on this past summer. Despite the best efforts of those in a position of power at Old Trafford, the Englishman turned down the offer to renew his contract in Manchester, in favour of a new challenge on the continent. View this post on Instagram It’s took me a while because it’s not been easy to put my emotions into words. Sadly the time has come to end a beautiful chapter that has been my life for 14 years. Being from Salford, Manchester United is all I have ever known. I went from playing on my estate, pretending to be Wayne Rooney to being in the academy And doing the same. May 21st 2017 I made my premier league debut for the club of my dreams aged 16 replacing the legend himself ‘Wayne Rooney’. I want to thank every single individual at the club for the help and encouragement I received, from the very first time I signed at the club. I want to thank all the coaches from every age group that looked after me from 6 to now. To all the kit men, Kath the receptionist, The media team, the security, the staff at the cliff, the staff at Littleton road, the staff at Carrington to the cleaners, you all played a part in getting me to where I am today. It is time I take the next step in my career, I hope you can all be proud off what I go on to achieve. I wish the club and everyone involved the best of luck, you will all be missed more than you can imagine. I also want to thank the fans, your SUPPORT hasn’t gone unnoticed. Once a RED always a RED  UTID Angel Gomes A post shared by  Angel Gomes (@angel.gomes10) on Aug 4, 2020 at 7:55am PDT Gomes opted to make the move to Lille. putting pen to paper on a 5-year deal with the Ligue 1 outfit. Amid strong competition for places in the midfield ranks at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, however, it was decided that a campaign out on loan would best benefit Gomes’ development. In turn, he linked up with Portuguese side Boavista for the 2020/21 season. And it is with Vasco Seabra’s men that the gifted youngster has finally been able to showcase his unquestionable talents on the senior stage. To this point, Gomes has notched 5 league appearances for Boavista. And, across these outings, the Englishman has directly contributed to 5 goals. A dazzling performance versus Primeira Liga giants Benfica last week proved Gomes’ crowning moment thus far, as the former United man drove his side to a shock 3-0 victory with equal guile, vision and cutting edge. ‘This boy has magic in his feet’, former Portugal and Atletico Madrid star Paulo Futre recently exclaimed when drawn on Gomes’ talents during an interview with Record (as cited by Goal). His latest display of brilliance, meanwhile, did not take long to follow, as the London native danced his way to a wonderful solo strike at Farense on Sunday: GOLO!
