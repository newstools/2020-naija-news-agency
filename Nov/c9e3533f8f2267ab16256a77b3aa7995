Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has provided updates on a pair of his side’s key attackers, ahead of the club’s meeting with Sheffield United. The Blues are set to return to Premier League action this weekend, in a Stamford Bridge clash with Chris Wilder’s men. Chelsea will of course head into proceedings brimming with confidence, on the back of a major upturn in form of late. Having managed to get the club’s defensive woes under control, in large part thanks to the influence of summer additions Thiago Silva and Edouard Mendy, Lampard’s men are now unbeaten in their last 7 outings across all competitions. This run includes 5 consecutive clean sheets, and wins in their last 3. The latest of these came on Wednesday night, when Chelsea made short work of Ligue 1 outfit Rennes, to maintain top spot in the Champions League Group E table.

And, as Saturday’s matchup inches ever closer, Frank Lampard this afternoon held his pre-Blades press conference. The key takeaway from the presser came in the form of updates on the potential participation of a pair of Blues attackers tomorrow evening. First up was Christian Pulisic. United States international Pulisic played no part in Chelsea’s win over Rennes on Wednesday, after picking up a hamstring injury during the warmup prior to the Londoners’ meeting with Burnley last weekend. And, though there had been hope that he would return to fitness in time to take on Sheffield United, Lampard has since confirmed that the 22-year-old is in fact set to miss out once again: ‘Not fit to play, still suffering with his hamstring.’ ‘He trained at a low level in midweek and wasn’t comfortable. We have to keep looking for the right solution.’ <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159486469.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY – AUGUST 03: Christian Pulisic of FC Chelsea looks on during the pre-season friendly match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and FC Chelsea at Borussia-Park on August 3, 2019 in Moenchengladbach, Germany.

German hitman Werner was initially omitted from Chelsea’s XI to take on Burnley last weekend, only to be introduced at the last-minute on the back of Pulisic’s injury. The Blues summer signing was then utilised from the off once again versus Rennes in midweek. As such, it had been suggested that Frank Lampard may opt to leave his side’s in-form goalscorer out on Saturday, to provide Werner with some much needed rest. After confirming that this had been his intention last weekend, though, Lampard hinted that Werner is likely to be handed yet another start versus Sheffield United: Lampard says he was planning on giving Timo Werner a rest at Burnley but obviously that didn’t happen. He says he will look to manage his minutes in the future but not necessarily tomorrow, particularly as he is in such good form and building relationships.#CHESHU — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) November 6, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
