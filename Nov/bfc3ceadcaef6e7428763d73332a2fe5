Hot picks include Davido's #ABT album, Darkovibes "The Cornerstone" EP, Timaya, Sarkodie, Peruzzi, Umu Obiligbo, Alpha P, Yemi Alade, and many more. Enjoy! Davido – The Best ft. Mayorkun Davido's "A Better Time" album is what everyone's listening to right now, with so many bangers in it. In spite of all the heavy tunes, including international collabos with the likes of Nicki Minaj, the current consensus is that Mayorkun dropped the album's hardest verse on "The Best". Read #ABT Review Davido – Holy Ground ft. Nicki Minaj She call me brother. I call her sister too! Mama so fine, she get like 6 tattoos. If she was a city, she be Timbuktu. My Holy Ground wey me I run to. How many of you caught the "Timbuktu" and "Holy Ground" reference. For those who don't know, Mali's capital, Timbuktu was seen as the “holy ground” of Islam in Africa in the 15th and 16th Century. The religion spread across the continent from there. Timaya – Gra Gra Perennial hitmaker Timaya is set to drop his new album, Gratitude, shortly. As a lead-up to the release, he put out a fresh joint "Gra Gra". This is vintage Timaya is his full Afro-Reggae element. Click to watch video Peruzzi – Isolova With a new album on the horizon, DMW act Peruzzi dishes out a contender for "December Jam" with Isolova.
