Held in Lagos, the event tagged ‘Women Making a Difference Community Service Leadership Awards’ is an initiative of Spotlight African Network.

They show that hard work pays, diligence pays, and showing leadership actually pays,” said Mike-Nnaji. According to her, during COVID-19, Ebola, these women, described as ‘Ladies in the Orange Jumpsuit,’ kept sweeping, and keeping Lagos clean; stating the women are the COVID heroes and they need to be celebrated. She said that the motivating factor was also to celebrate women, not only sweepers but also grassroots women who are heroes in what they actually do in Africa – making a difference.
