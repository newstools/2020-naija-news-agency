Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell has highlighted the strength in depth in Frank Lampard’s squad, on the back of the club’s victory over Burnley. Lampard’s men made the trip to Turf Moor on Saturday, for their latest Premier League outing. The clash marked a return to domestic action for Chelsea, who headed into proceedings fresh off a morale-boosting win in midweek. A visit to Russia to take on Krasnodar in the club’s 2nd Champions League outing of the campaign saw the visitors thoroughly dominate, en route to a 4-0 victory. And, when all was said and done yesterday evening, the upturn in form being enjoyed by the Londoners continued. Another stellar display saw Chelsea make short work of hosts Burnley, putting 3 past the Clarets to climb back into the Premier League’s top-4. Hakim Ziyech, Kurt Zouma and Timo Werner were the players on target, with highlights of the clash showcased below. One concern on an otherwise positive evening all-round for Chelsea on Saturday, though, came on the personnel front. After being named in the visitors’ initial starting XI at Turf Moor, Christian Pulisic was withdrawn just moments prior to kick-off, after picking up a hamstring injury during his warm-up. Lampard’s lineup did not exactly suffer much of a drop in quality following the United States international’s exit, though, with Timo Werner having been on standby to step in. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1269509569-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1269509569-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1269509569-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1269509569-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 29: Timo Werner of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his team’s first goal during the pre-season friendly between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at Amex Stadium on August 29, 2020 in Brighton, England.

And, as outlined above, one such individual is Ben Chilwell. The English international, who impressed once again yesterday, has revealed his opinion that the intense competition for places at Stamford Bridge will help to ‘push’ his side ‘forward’: ‘Unfortunately, Christian got injured in the warm-up and we are all disappointed for him’, Chilwell explained during an interview with Chelsea’s official website. ‘But when you’ve got Timo to come in it’s a positive and shows what strength in depth we have.’ ‘That competition pushes us all, and it’s one of the key components to a good squad. We have a lot of good players, two or three in each position who are fighting for the shirt. That will help push us forward.’ Hakim Ziyech happy with life at Chelsea: ‘I am where I am supposed to be’ Aubameyang avenges RVP, Pogba’s mistakes prove costly again and the key stats as Arsenal down Man United Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
