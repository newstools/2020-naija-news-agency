In his words: It was just timing mehn, to be honest, I recorded FEM since May. There's a post on my page where I put the snippet of FEM for like 20 seconds, this is like May or June. I didn't see this coming, I dropped it, few weeks later everyone singing FEM at the protest ground. I even went to the national state-building and they said Davido you went to sing a song for us, I said no oh! I recorded that song since May and it just happened to be by chance. I was happy to see them use my music as a voice and not being violent. Many have regarded FEM as the anthem for #ENDSARS protest but as Davido said, this is more about timing than an intentional act.
