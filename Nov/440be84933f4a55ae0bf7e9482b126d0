Chelsea’s under-21 side were in cup action on Wednesday evening with a few notable takeaways from the game showcased below. The Blues were in EFL Trophy action against League One outfit, Bristol Rovers. Chelsea headed into the tie in desperate need of three points to keep their qualification hopes alive. However, despite some positive individual displays, the Londoners eventually fell to a 4-3 defeat, leaving them bottom of Group 12. Brandon Hanlan would open the scoring for the home side just 10 minutes in. Chelsea would hit back just moments later after Tino Anjorin slotted home from Valentino Livramento’s superb through-ball. However, the home side then went on to dominate, netting twice before the hour-mark. A second Anjorin strike and a goal from Lewis Marcel eventually brought Chelsea back on level terms, but a late Josh Hare effort saw Bristol emerge with all three points. You can check out the highlights from the tie below: <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdstXeacHVY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe> On a fairly negative evening for Chelsea’s youngsters, there were a handful of positives. First up, 18-year-old Anjorin, who was handed his senior debut by Frank Lampard last season, looked pretty lively throughout the 90 minutes and of course, scored a brace. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1206146835-1024x683.jpg"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – MARCH 08: Tino Anjorin of Chelsea during the Premier League match between Chelsea FC and Everton FC at Stamford Bridge on March 8, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The Scotsman missed around four months of action after picking up a knee injury vs Crystal Palace in July. And after a brief return to action last week for Scotland’s under-21s, in which Gilmour was sent off after just 10 minutes on the pitch, the youngster is now seemingly making great strides in his recovery, manging an hour against Bristol.
