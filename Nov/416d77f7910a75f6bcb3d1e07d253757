Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola held his pre-Liverpool press conference this afternoon, with a number of noteworthy takeaways having been forthcoming. The marquee fixture of the coming Premier League weekend will see City welcome Jurgen Klopp’s men to the Etihad. The matchup of course marks a meeting between the champions of the last two seasons, with Sunday’s visitors in current possession of the title of English football’s best. Liverpool will no doubt head to Manchester brimming with confidence, on the back of a stellar spell of form of late. A run of 4 consecutive wins across all competitions was extended on Tuesday night, when the Merseysiders ran riot in Italy, to put Atalanta to the sword by 5 goals to nil. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1283752312-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1283752312-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1283752312-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1283752312-1024x713.jpg?resize=1024%2C713&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BERGAMO, ITALY – NOVEMBER 03: Diogo Jota of Liverpool FC celebrates his second goal with his team-mate Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah during the UEFA Champions League Group D stage match between Atalanta BC and Liverpool FC at Gewiss Stadium on November 03, 2020 in Bergamo, Italy.

Since returning from last month’s international break, the Sky Blues have racked up 5 wins from 6, with their only stalemate over this stretch having come at in-form West Ham two weeks ago. As such, as Sunday’s Etihad showdown inches ever closer, excitement has understandably begun to ramp up. And, as outlined above, in anticipation of his side’s meeting with the champions, Pep Guardiola this afternoon held a press conference filled with interesting takeaways. The first came after the City boss was drawn on the importance of this weekend’s clash, when it comes to the overall picture of the Premier League title race. Guardiola, though, whilst admitting that the matchup evidently marks a significant one, played down its magnitude when taking the campaign as a whole into account, by use of an interesting metaphor: ‘It is an important game but, like the presidential elections in the USA, all the votes must be counted – there are a lot of points to play for.’ The other key point from the City’ boss exchange with the media, meanwhile, surrounded Sergio Aguero. Argentine hitman Aguero has not featured in any of the Citizens’ last three outings, since picking up a hamstring injury versus West Ham. And, unfortunately for the Sky Blues faithful, Guardiola went on to confirm that Aguero will not make his return to the pitch versus Liverpool: ‘No, he is not ready, not yet.’ Pep Guardiola gives Sergio Aguero fitness update before Liverpool showdown https://t.co/Q9mlJoyP0Q — Indy Football (@IndyFootball) November 6, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
