A recent report from England has linked Everton with a trio of Tottenham’s fringe stars. Though Tottenham have had a superb start to the campaign, there are still a few players at the club who probably aren’t too happy right now. The most obvious is, of course, Dele Alli who has notched just 243 minutes of actions for Tottenham across all competitions this season. Elsewhere, Harry Winks has also hinted at concern over his current minutes at Tottenham recently. Winks was a fairly regular contributor under Jose Mourinho at the beginning of the campaign. However, Winks has since been afforded a total of just 17 minutes of action across the Lilywhites’ last five league outings. In fact, he missed out on a place in the club’s matchday squad altogether vs both West Brom, Burnley and Manchester City. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1185818935-1024x731.jpg" alt="Everton reportedly interested in Tottenham trio, including Dele Alli"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 26: Harry Winks of Tottenham Hotspur controls the ball during the UEFA Champions League group B match between Tottenham Hotspur and Olympiacos FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on November 26, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

It is claimed that Everton have set their sights on three Spurs players ahead of the upcoming January window. Said players are Alli, Winks and Paulo Gazzaniga – the latter of which is seemingly now the Lilywhites’ third-choice keeper behind Hugo Lloris and Joe Hart. Football Insider add that Everton are set to concentrate on the loan market in the next window, with Alli and Winks both potentially fitting into that category. As for Gazzaniga, FI speculate that the Argentine could be available on a permanent basis due to his current role. The shot-stopper has just under two years remaining on his deal with Spurs.
