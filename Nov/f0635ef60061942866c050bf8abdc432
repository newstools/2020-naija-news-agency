He is a player that I want to stay at the club. I love working with young players. You can see the talent is there, the ambition is there and he can fit with our stricture and progress in the future. He’s part of the DNA and myself and the club are working to try to extend his contract.” “We’re trying to change the situation that we are in at the moment with him, and trying to convince him that this is the right place for him.” said Arteta at his pre-match press conference.

He has some responsibility, I have a lot of responsibility, which is to get the best out of him and get the best position for him, the best areas where he can do what he can do with the ball. I cannot fault his effort at all.” “You see the way he strives for the team, the way he’s working, it’s been the best since he’s been at the club. But there have been some aspects he can do better in because he has the ability. That’s where I’m going to put the pressure on him to deliver what he can do. To say it’s a threat for him to finish his career… it’s not at all like that.” Arsenal have seen Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Ozil suffer the wrath of Arteta in regards to being frozen out. Guendouzi left the club to go Hertha Berlin on loan after a number of disciplinary issues and Ozil was not included in Arteta’s squads for the Premier League and Europa League.
