Tottenham defender Sergio Reguilon was today quick to jump to the defence of former club Real Madrid, during a press conference whilst on international duty. Spanish stopper Reguilon of course made the move to north London during the summer. On the back of a stellar campaign on loan with Sevilla, the 23-year-old was named as a target for a whole host of European clubs. This came with both Ferland Mendy and Marcelo remaining at the disposal of Zinedine Zidane, making a route to consistent first-team football at the Bernabeu a difficult one. Spurs, in turn, were more than happy to take advantage of the situation, with Jose Mourinho’s men having since reaped the benefits. Reguilon has slotted seamlessly into the Lilywhites’ backline, adding a new element of attacking vigour to the club’s ranks on the left flank. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1278610246.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 04: Sergio Reguilon of Tottenham Hotspur during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on October 04, 2020 in Manchester, England.

Elsewhere, the capital outfit currently sit top of their Europa League group (albeit only by goal difference), and booked their spot in the quarter-finals of the League Cup at the expense of London rivals Chelsea. As such, it is fair to say that, all told, Reguilon has enjoyed a positive start to life in England. Things at former club Real Madrid, however, have not proven quite so rosy over the early weeks of the campaign. The Spanish champions currently sit 4th in the La Liga table, with their heavy defeat at Valencia over the weekend having come as Los Blancos’ 2nd in the club’s last 4 league outings. On the European stage, meanwhile, where Zinedine Zidane’s men have so long thrived, Real have notched just one win from their opening 3 Champions League fixtures. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-963113010-1024x643.jpg?resize=1024%2C643&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zinedine Zidane" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-963113010-1024x643.jpg?resize=1024%2C643&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-963113010-1024x643.jpg?resize=1024%2C643&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zinedine Zidane" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-963113010-1024x643.jpg?resize=1024%2C643&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zinedine Zidane" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MADRID, SPAIN – MAY 27: Zinedine Zidane, Manager of Real Madrid is thrown in the air by his players during celebrations at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium following their victory last night in Kiev in the UEFA Champions League final, on May 27, 2018 in Madrid, Spain.

The stopper, though, was having none of it, backing Zidane and co. to ‘fix’ their recent issues, and book their spot in the last-16 of the Champions League: ‘Facing Madrid in Europa League? Oh shut up man, shut up – that would be a very bad sign. Madrid is going to move on, they will fix what is happening in the Champions League.’ Another interesting takeaway from Reguilon’s press conference was the 23-year-old’s take on Gareth Bale’s current mindset. Welsh international Bale of course joined his ex-Blancos teammate in north London during the summer, and Reguilon feels that the Spurs icon is now both ‘happier’ and more ‘comfortable’ than he was whilst in Spain: ‘Bale sometimes even acts as a translator for some specific things. He is much more comfortable speaking English with all his colleagues, it shows a lot. I see him happier, comfortable in a team.’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
