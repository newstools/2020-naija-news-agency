An update on the fitness of Arsenal star Thomas Partey has been forthcoming online. Mikel Arteta’s men are set to return to action following the international break this weekend. The Gunners will make the trip to Elland Road on Sunday, for a Premier League meeting with Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds. Arsenal will of course head into proceedings desperate for a bounce-back result, on the back of a frankly embarrassing display in the club’s last outing. The north Londoners welcomed Aston Villa to the Emirates two weekends ago, aiming to build on an impressive win at Old Trafford in their prior outing. When all was said and done, however, a harrowing 90 minutes for all associated with the club saw Arsenal downed by 3 goals to nil. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg?resize=1024%2C715&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg?resize=1024%2C715&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg?resize=1024%2C715&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg?resize=1024%2C715&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

The summer arrival in the English capital was forced off at the interval, after pulling up in clear discomfort towards the end of the first-half. Speaking in the aftermath of his side’s defeat, Mikel Arteta was cautious in providing an exact diagnosis on Partey, ahead of scheduled medical scans for the Ghanaian: ‘We don’t know [the extent] of it. We have to scan him tomorrow or the day after and see what he felt straight away. Let’s wait and see what the magnitude of the injury is.’ Regarding Partey’s potential participation in his country’s latest round of fixtures, meanwhile, Arteta added: ‘I don’t know [if he will go away with Ghana now]. As I said, the doctor will have to have a look at him and probably scan him. Then we will decide what to do with him.’ An update on Thomas Partey#ARSAVL — Arsenal (@Arsenal) November 8, 2020 The former Atletico Madrid standout, though, in the end, did not link up with Ghana’s squad for the Black Stars’ AFCON qualifying double-header with Sudan. As a result, it had since remained altogether unclear how serious Partey’s injury was. If the latest word stemming from social media over the last 24 hours is to be believed, though, then Arsenal’s fans need not fret. As per a report from the AFC Bell, regarded as extremely reliable when it comes to Gunners-related news, Partey will be available to face Leeds this weekend. The update comes courtesy of the midfielder’s inner circle, who confirmed as much during an exclusive interview over the weekend: توماس بارتي سيكون متاحًا لمباراة أرسنال القادمة بعد التوقف الدولي مباشرة نقلاً عن دائرة اللاعب المقربة في حديث مع #جرس_أرسنال — TheAFCBell (@TheAFCBeII) November 15, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
