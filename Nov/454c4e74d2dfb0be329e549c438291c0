Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has this evening moved to shut down speculation of a potential departure for Dean Henderson. Much has of course been made of the battle for supremacy between the posts at Old Trafford over recent months. Spanish international David de Gea once again acted as the Red Devils’ no.1 last season, with Sergio Romero on standby as a highly reliable backup. However, whilst he was once viewed by most as the world’s finest shot-stopper, de Gea’s form has proven questionable at best for some time now. This, combined with the fact that Dean Henderson returned to Manchester this summer on the back of a 2nd stellar season on loan with Sheffield United, has given rise to something of a dilemma for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1257070010-1024x664.jpg" alt="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer clarifies Dean Henderson’s Man United future"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – JULY 19: David De Gea of Manchester United reacts during the FA Cup Semi Final match between Manchester United and Chelsea at Wembley Stadium on July 19, 2020 in London, England.

And, to his credit, the 30-year-old, for the most part, has stepped up with Henderson breathing down his neck. Where, though, does this leave Manchester United’s no.2? Henderson proved himself as one of the finest shot-stoppers in the Premier League in 2019/20, and, at 23, is in desperate need of regular game-time amid such a crucial period in his development. 3 appearances across the Red Devils’ first 12 outings of the campaign was therefore no doubt far from what Henderson had in mind. In turn, it should come as little surprise to see murmurs beginning to mount in the press, hinting at a January Old Trafford exit for the former Carlisle youth. The last week alone has seen all of Brighton, Leeds and Celtic tipped as potential January landing spots for the Englishman. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171631757-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dean Henderson"/> Sheffield United’s English goalkeeper Dean Henderson reacts during the English Premier League football match between Sheffield United and Liverpool at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, northern England on September 28, 2019.

If the Norwegian’s comments were anything to go by, however, then it appears altogether unlikely that the Red Devils no.2 will be on the move any time soon. In fact, Solskjaer went as far as to assure that Henderson is fully committed to remaining at Old Trafford, to fight for his place between the sticks: ‘Dean wants to stay at Manchester United and play for Manchester United.’ When pressed further on the possibility that, if he is not handed a starting berth tomorrow night, a League Cup meeting with Everton next month could represent Henderson’s only remaining opportunity for game-time before January, the United boss added: ‘I can’t see the logic in him playing only one game before Christmas. Do you know how many games we’ve got? So I disagree completely that Tuesday could be make or break for Dean.’ ‘He has come back in, he is training really well, he is maturing’, Solskjaer continued. ‘He is training with, for me, one of the best goalkeepers in the world. He has got potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.’ ‘It’s a great competition between them, so I don’t buy that argument that it is a make or break for him.’ “He has got potential to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.
