Mauricio Pochettino this evening provided an insight into his plans to return to management, amid rumours of interest on the part of a number of top clubs. Argentine tactician Pochettino is of course best remembered for his time spent in the Premier League. Following a 3-year stint in charge of Espanyol, the 48-year-old opted to make the move to Southampton in 2013, before linking up with Tottenham a year later. And it was his spell in north London which saw Pochettino go on to establish himself as one of the most highly-regarded managers in not only England, but all of Europe. The former Argentinian international guided Spurs to top-4 finishes in four of his five seasons with the club, including a runners-up berth in 2016-17. Poch’s crowning achievement, though, came two seasons ago, when, miraculously, he oversaw the Lilywhites’ run all the way to the final of the Champions League. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142303841-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tottenham Champions League" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142303841-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142303841-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tottenham Champions League" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142303841-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tottenham Champions League" data-recalc-dims="1" /> AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS – MAY 08: Mauricio Pochettino head coach / manager of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates with his players and coaching staff at full time during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final second leg match between Ajax and Tottenham Hotspur at the Johan Cruyff Arena on May 8, 2019 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

And, somewhat surprisingly, the South American has since remained out of work. Pochettino has been linked with a whole host of top clubs, including the likes of Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Reports stemming from Russia last week, meanwhile, went as far as to claim that the tactician was in active talks over a potential position at Zenit St. Petersburg. Whatever the case may be when it comes to which clubs in particular are after Pochettino, though, one thing is for certain – he is ready to return to the bench. Speaking during a guest appearance on Sky Sports this evening, the former Spurs boss was drawn on his plans for the future. And Poch, who’s odds to take over at Old Trafford have tumbled since Man United’s defeat to Arsenal on Sunday, went on to confirm that he is actively ‘looking for work’: ‘I always feel ready to be involved in the game again. I love football, it’s my passion, it’s my job.’ ‘I am looking for work. I love the game. I’m working and doing things but it’s not the same as being involved every single day and sharing with your players and staff. You miss that, that’s the reality.’ ‘It’s not stressful when you are working. It’s not stressful to go into the training ground, to prepare the team, to compete.’ – ‘I’m always ready to be involved in the game!’ Mauricio Pochettino insists he is ready to return to football and is ‘looking forward’… Watch #MNF live on Sky Sports Premier League now! pic.twitter.com/zzo1LoQD1S — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 2, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
