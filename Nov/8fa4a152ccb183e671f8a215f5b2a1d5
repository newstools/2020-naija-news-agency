After a short break in which several artists paused their releases, we finally got fresh content over the last week or thereabouts. Here's our selection of the best new music released over the past week. Wizkid – Made In Lagos Yes! After postponing multiple times, Wizkid FINALLY released his heavily anticipated album, "Made In Lagos." Read up our review, and watch the "No Stress" video. You can also peep Wizkid's breakdown of #MIL with Ebro on Apple Music. Burna Boy – 20 10 20 20 10 20 will always be remembered as the day Nigerian Armed Forces opened fire on peaceful #EndSARS protesters in what is now known as the #LekkiMassacre. Ceeza Milli – Based on What? Ceeza Milli released his first post-Aristokrat single at the tail-end of last month. A real tough joint that could do some damage this final quarter of 2020. DJ Neptune – Nobody (Icons Remix) ft. Joeboy, Laycon BBNaija winner, Laycon walked into the Big Brother House as a relative unknown, and walked out of the reality tv show as a bonafide superstar. Within days, DJ Neptune tapped him for an Icons Remix to one of the biggest songs of 2020, "Nobody". There's also a Canada Remix featuring Kardinal Offishall, Jayd Ink, 4Corners, Mr Eazi & Joeboy. Duncan Mighty – Boma Port Harcourt 1st Son, Duncan Mighty samples the all-time classic "Africa" by American Rock band, Toto, on his latest single "Boma". This one is about a girl named "Boma." It's a nice twist. Banky W – Talk and Do While the #EndSARS movement has no leader, Banky W certainly played a role in growing the protests in Lagos. The Entertainment mogul brought together a stellar cast of musicians to deliver this socio-conscious piece. Governor of Africa ft. Peruzzi – Cincinnati Not a lot to say, other than the fact that this is a f**king jam! Ruzzi is a problem! Watch the video here. MzVee ft. Medikal – Hallelujah If you're looking for a song to uplift your spirits in these troubling times, look no further. Watch the video here. Adina – Araba (Album) Here's a new album from Ghanaian singer Adina Thembi. If you're looking for a solid project to binge through, I highly recommend "Araba". Bisa K'dei – Sika ft. Gyakie These two are developing the habit of making great music. First, it was "Sor Mu Mi". Now this. R2bees ft, Sarkodie – Yawa R2bees & Sarkodie are two of the legendary names in Ghanaian music over the past decade. They combine forces yet again on this new song "Yawa". Watch the video here.
