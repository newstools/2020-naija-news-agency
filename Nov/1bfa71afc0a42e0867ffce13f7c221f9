The woes facing Mikel Arteta and Arsenal only deepened this evening, as the club stumbled to an altogether undeserved share of the spoils versus Leeds. The Gunners made the trip to Elland Road a short time ago, in their return to action following the international break. Arsenal of course headed into proceedings desperate for all 3 points, on the back of an embarrassing 3-0 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa last time out. In turn, ahead of kick-off this evening, the north Londoners sat in a lowly 13th spot in the Premier League table. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="The Arsenal sh*tshow continues: As Pepe costs Gunners vs Leeds, Mesut Ozil in heated back-and-forth with Piers Morgan"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

Another underwhelming display on the part of Arteta’s men eventually saw the visitors escape with a share of the spoils. Few, though, would argue that the Gunners were in fact deserving of a point. Leeds, throughout proceedings, peppered the goal of the capital giants, with Rodrigo (twice) and Patrick Bamford having seen 2nd-half efforts come back off the woodwork. At the other end, Arsenal’s only real opportunity of note came late on, when Bukayo Saka, after being slipped through one-on-one, saw his left-footed strike well saved by Illan Meslier. As such, after seeing all of Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United pick up wins already this weekend, the Londoners remain in the bottom half of the Premier League table, 4 points off the early top-4 pace. Perfectly summing up everything that appears wrong at Arsenal at present, meanwhile, was the red card picked up by Nicolas Pepe this evening. The Ivorian, handed a rare chance to impress by Mikel Arteta, struggled to impact proceedings at Elland Road, before essentially killing off any chance of a snatch-and-grab win for his side early in the 2nd-half. After being involved in a coming together with Ezgjan Alioski off the ball, Pepe stupidly drove his head forward into that of the Leeds man. It therefore came as little surprise when, following a quick VAR check, the former Lille standout was sent for a deserved early bath: PEPE SENT OFF The Arsenal man headbutts Ezgjan Alioski off the ball and is shown a straight red card Watch on Sky Sports PL Follow #LEEARS here: https://t.co/ikn2qWt06u Download the @SkySports app! pic.twitter.com/ZjeVi3H4MC — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 22, 2020 Nicolas Pépé has now received as many red cards in the Premier League this season as he has produced goals and assists combined (1). https://t.co/fgSt9d8ogC — Squawka Football (@Squawka) November 22, 2020 It should also be noted that Pepe’s dismissal comes just days after reports surfaced in the media surrounding a major bust-up in Arsenal training, hinting at a potential discipline problem in Mikel Arteta’s ranks as things stand. It therefore almost goes without saying that those to have taken to the pitch for the Gunners this evening did not exactly cover themselves in glory. Bizarrely, though, another of the club’s most high-profile stars, whilst watching on from home, also saw his name cast into the spotlight over the last couple of hours. The player in question? Mesut Ozil. Taking to Twitter ahead of kick-off, German international Ozil, who remains frozen out by Mikel Arteta at present, posted a message of support to his teammates: Let’s goooooo…  #COYG #YaGunnersYa — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) November 22, 2020 One individual to have evidently taken issue with the tone of the 32-year-old’s post, though, was the ever outspoken Piers Morgan, who responded by revealing his hope that Ozil soon secures a departure from the club: I wish you would, Mesut.For your sake and Arsenal’s. https://t.co/guyV1K2gP2 — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 22, 2020 Ozil, not prepared to accept Morgan’s jibe lying down, soon hit back, highlighting past accusations of phone hacking on the part of the TV presenter: Piers, was that really you, or was your phone hacked?  https://t.co/g2GW6YTE8R — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) November 22, 2020 Morgan, however, never one to back down from a war of words, then made things even more personal, attacking Ozil over both his lack of game-time, and long-criticised mammoth wage packet: I must say @MesutOzil1088, I admire your nerve in trolling Arsenal fans who pay your wages given you’re getting £350k-a-week of OUR money to sit on your a*se doing f*ck all. Try training as hard as you work on being a clever dick. Then the manager might pick you. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 22, 2020 The German is yet to respond.
