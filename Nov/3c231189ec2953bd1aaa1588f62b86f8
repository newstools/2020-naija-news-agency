Former Arsenal star Jack Wilshere has taken to social media, to lightheartedly hint at a return to the club. The woes of Mikel Arteta’s men of course continued on Sunday. After slipping to 13th in the Premier League table on the back of an embarrassing 3-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa prior to the international break, the Gunners returned to action 24 hours ago, in a trip to Elland Road. When all was said and done in west Yorkshire, however, Arsenal were out-thought, out-fought and frankly outplayed by Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds. Though the north Londoners managed to secure a share of the spoils, it was the hosts who dominated when it came to both possession and chances created, rattling the woodwork on three occasions in the 2nd-half alone.

Following a public outcry on the part of the Gunners faithful, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was utilised in a central role versus Leeds. However, the former Dortmund man was once again starved of any real service. Elsewhere, a return to the tried and tested midfield pairing of Dani Ceballos and Granit Xhaka also, unsurprisingly, didn’t miraculously solve Arsenal’s problems. Nicolas Pepe’s latest attempt to prove his worth in a starting berth blew up in Mikel Arteta’s face, whilst Willian’s complete lack of influence on proceedings at Elland Road almost felt inevitable. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229736932-1024x682.jpg" alt="Jack Wilshere hints he could be the man to solve Arsenal’s problems"/> Arsenal’s French-born Ivorian midfielder Nicolas Pepe (L) is shown a red card by atch Referee Anthony Taylor (2R) during the English Premier League football match between Leeds United and Arsenal at Elland Road in Leeds, northern England on November 22, 2020.

As outlined above, however, one man who evidently feels that he could be the missing link in putting an end to the woes of the Gunners is none other than Jack Wilshere. Taking to social media on the back of the capital giants’ latest stalemate, ex-Arsenal midfielder Wilshere drew attention to a post highlighting his one-time club’s struggles of late. And the 28-year-old, a free agent following his summer release from West Ham, accompanied his tweet with a less-than-subtle (albeit presumably lighthearted) hint that he is readily available to contribute: https://t.co/e4pkRlO9bv — Jack Wilshere (@JackWilshere) November 22, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
