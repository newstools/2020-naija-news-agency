Over 6 foot in height, the forward can play both centrally and in wider positions. His technical skill in combination with powerful strength makes him a nightmare for opposition defenders. Often tricking full-backs with a step-over or two, Corbeanu presents one of the most unique profiles in the game. Born in Canada to Romanian parents, Theodor Corbeanu gravitated towards the football whilst far from the nation’s most popular sport. Speaking to Tackle.ro, Corbeanu said that despite the sport’s lesser popularity amongst others, the quality in the country is on the rise. “In Canada, football is not as popular as it should be. Other sports like hockey, American football, and basketball are more popular, but football is growing quickly and Europeans should not underestimate the ability of Canadian players, especially U21 and younger,” said the former Toronto winger. Joining the Toronto academy, Corbeanu was part of the club when the side was an MLS favourite. Several former European players had joined the ranks and led to a competitive streak even a MLS trophy. “My time at Toronto FC academy coincided with the greatest period in the club’s history. Players like Sebastian Giovinco, Victor Vasquez and Jozy Altidore brought a very attractive style of football to Toronto which caught the eye of the footballing world,” said Corbeanu. “Unfortunately, this past season has not been great for the club, but this happens in football.” Corbeanu travelled across the Atlantic to join Wolverhampton Wanderers youth academy in 2018. He has impressed since his arrival and in 2020 after two successful years, earning a place in the under-23 squad, he signed a new 3-year contract. Wolves academy manager Scott Sellars said, “We feel it was the right time to reward him for what he’s done. He’s trained with the first-team quite a lot and they’re pleased with his progress, so it’s a reward for his consistency.” Despite having Romanian parents and representing the nation at youth level, Corbeanu has now decided to represent Canada.  “I started off with the Romanian national team, but now I’m going to play for Canada,” Corbeanu said in an interview with Wolves’ official website. 101 spoke to Canadian football scout Mahith Gamage. He might have featured for the Romanian youth teams, but Wolves and Toronto FC youth product Theo Corbeanu has verbally committed to represent his birth nation at international level – Canada. The right-winger and forward has been highly-rated within the Wolves set-up. Theo Corbeanu’s profile is that of a very complete winger, which is something you don’t come across every day. In reality, he has a little bit of everything in him. He’s got the power in his game, which will likely never disappear. He can drive at players on the flanks and really go shoulder-to-shoulder with anyone. Along with that, he has the technical quality and the end product to make things happen for the team, which ultimately is the most important thing. While Jonathan David and Alphonso Davies will be Canada’s A-Lister’s in the long-term, there’s no denying that Theo Corbeanu can play a strong supporting character as Canada aim to reach new heights. The initial thing which strikes you about Corbeanu is the height he possesses for his position. The wingers which dominate Europe have a typically smaller frame. The likes of Raheem Sterling, Serge Gnabry and Sadio Mane use their lower centre of gravity to wrong foot opponents and accelerate past with ease. Reaching nearly 6’3, Corbeanu does not have this physical advantage however uses his strength and deceptive speed in combination with technical ability to beat opponents and reach threatening positions. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-10-1024x576.png" alt="Corbeanu is always looking to beat players and stride towards the touch-line in order to create a scoring opportunity or cut back."/> Corbeanu is always looking to beat players and stride towards the touch-line in order to create a scoring opportunity or cut back. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-11-1024x576.png" alt="Using his skill on the ball, Corbeanu beats his man with a series of step overs before striking the ball at the keeper."/> Using his skill on the ball, Corbeanu beats his man with a series of step overs before striking the ball at the keeper. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-12-1024x576.png" alt="When skill may not work, Corbeanu has another weapon available which the smaller wingers lack.

Corbeanu can operate on either flank and when on the left will often cut inside to find a shot or an incisive or cross-field pass. The Canadian’s shooting is a weaker area of his game which will develop as he matures but Corbeanu has a good eye for space and will try to find opponents in threatening situations. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-12-1024x576.png" alt="Operating on the left, Corbeanu cuts inside with his teammate making the incisive run with the Canadian could look to find."/> Operating on the left, Corbeanu cuts inside with his teammate making the incisive run with the Canadian could look to find. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-10-1024x576.png" alt="The original run from Corbeanu&#039;s teammate has been cut off.
