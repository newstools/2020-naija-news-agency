A quote, in which Hakim Ziyech revealed his affinity for Chelsea’s London rivals Arsenal, has come back to the fore online this weekend. Moroccan creator Ziyech of course joined Chelsea all the way back in February, as part of the Blues’ big-money recruitment drive ahead of the new campaign. The 27-year-old’s stint in southwest London, however, started out in altogether disappointing fashion. After picking up an injury during a pre-season meeting with Brighton, the north African went on to spend the ensuing 6 weeks on the sidelines. To say that, since his return, Ziyech has gone on to make up for lost time, though, would be putting it lightly. Since slowly working his way into the plans of Frank Lampard over the latter weeks of October, the former Ajax man has since established himself as an undisputed starter in Chelsea’s frontline. Across his first 4 starts for the club, meanwhile, Ziyech has directly contributed to 5 goals. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chelsea’s Moroccan midfielder Hakim Ziyech (3R) celebrates scoring the opening goal during the English Premier League football match between Burnley and Chelsea at Turf Moor in Burnley, north west England on October 31, 2020.

Superb. pic.twitter.com/8raugCIYS2 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 7, 2020 Such creative exploits, meanwhile, have proven central to the recent upturn in form being enjoyed by Chelsea. Whilst the likes of Edouard Mendy and Thiago Silva have of course played a key role in shoring up things at the back for Lampard’s men, it has been Ziyech tieing everything together up top. It is no coincidence that, after failing to score across a pair of meetings with Sevilla and Manchester United last month, Chelsea have since found the net 14 times in their ensuing 4 outings, all of which Ziyech started. As outlined above, however, as the gifted wide-man begins to showcase exactly why Roman Abramovich and co. opted to splash out on his signature in the first place, quotes, highlighting Ziyech’s prior allegiance to one of the Blues’ closest rivals, have resurfaced online. During a discussion with former teammate Justin Kluivert whilst at Ajax, Ziyech was drawn on which club he, at the time, would have most liked to join. And the Moroccan went on to name La Liga giants Barcelona, along with Arsenal, as his ‘ultimate dream’ destinations: ‘Well, I have two clubs. They are Arsenal and Barcelona.’ ‘That is my ultimate dream.’ Ziyech: “Which club would you like to go to in the future?” Kluivert: “Thats a good question, I like English football but my ultimate dream would be barca. And your ultimate dream?” Ziyech: “Well I have two clubs those are ARSENAL and Barcelona. Those are my ultimate dream.” pic.twitter.com/KezfGz6m8U — TheAFCnewsroom (@TheAFCnewsroom) May 18, 2019 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
