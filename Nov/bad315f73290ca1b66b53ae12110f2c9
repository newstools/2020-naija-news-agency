Olivier Giroud left Arsenal for Chelsea in January of 2018. The Frenchman has gone on to enjoy a decent stint at Stamford Bridge, though his game time, particularly in 2020, has taken a major hit. The first half of last season saw Giroud barely afforded a minute of action in the Premier league. This led to January speculation that the veteran forward was set to be on the move, with Tottenham and Inter Milan linked. However, in the end, a move failed to come to fruition. Amid the struggles of Tammy Abraham for both form and fitness, though, Giroud was subsequently handed a number of starts over the second half of the campaign. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1054584372-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud confirms he will have to make decision over future in January"/> BURNLEY, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 28: Olivier Giroud of Chelsea arrives outside the stadium prior to the Premier League match between Burnley FC and Chelsea FC at Turf Moor on October 28, 2018 in Burnley, United Kingdom.

The arrivals of Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech have seen the veteran slip even further down Frank Lampard’s attacking pecking order, with Giroud, in turn, having managed a dismal 36 minutes of league action. As such, with the European Championships just around the corner, Giroud’s game time at club level will likely need to increase dramatically, to ensure a regular spot for France. Didier Deschamps even recently urged his side’s hitman to ‘find another solution’ when it comes to playing time. Now, during an interview of his own with Telefoot, Giroud has spoken out over his lack of action at Chelsea. And the 34-year-old, unsurprisingly, appeared to hint at a potential departure from west London in January: “It’s worrying. I thought I still had a role to play at Chelsea but my playing time is getting reduced a lot. It’s going to have to change or a decision must be made. “I am clear-headed about my situation: I will have to make a decision in January. I hope to make the right one, as I have always done.” Quotes via Goal.
