The latest word online this evening suggests that Ainsley Maitland-Niles’ absence from Arsenal’s squad to take on Wolves has not come as a result of any form of injury. Mikel Arteta’s men are currently locked in action with Nuno Espirito Santo and co. at the Emirates, in a Premier League clash. The Gunners headed into proceedings desperate for all 3 points, having seen their positive early-season domestic form go up in smoke over recent weeks. Arsenal had managed just a solitary win across their last 5 Premier League outings before today, the latest of which saw the north London outfit lucky to escape Elland Road with a share of the spoils last weekend. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="Insight provided into Maitland-Niles’ latest Arsenal absence/Concern for Wolves’ Jimenez following sickening clash of heads"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

As it customary, an hour prior to kick-off, Mikel Arteta unveiled his latest Gunners XI set to take to the Emirates pitch. There were, as expected, a number of noteworthy absentees, with star summer signing Thomas Partey still on the sidelines, and Nicolas Pepe sitting out the first of a 3-match ban on the back of a petulant dismissal at Leeds: Tonight’s lineup is in! @BukayoSaka87 returns @Aubameyang7 continues up front @DavidLuiz_4 is alongside Gabriel #ARSWOL — Arsenal (@Arsenal) November 29, 2020 One surprise absentee from not only the hosts’ starting line-up, but the club’s matchday squad altogether this evening, however, was Ainsley Maitland-Niles. English international Maitland-Niles has endured a difficult campaign to this point, having dropped down the pecking order of manager Arteta. His complete omission versus Wolves, however, nevertheless raised a few eyebrows, with an insight into the situation having since, in turn, been forthcoming. And, if accurate, the news does not bode at all well for Arsenal’s versatile wing-back. It has been claimed that Maitland-Niles is in fact not carrying an injury, but was instead left out this evening simply for ‘tactical reasons’: No injury for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, misses out purely through tactical reasons. Could have been starting for the visitors here tonight… #AFC — Mark Mann-Bryans (@MarkyMBryans) November 29, 2020 Whilst Maitland-Niles is not thought to be carrying any form of fitness issue, the early exchanges in north London, on the other hand, have seen one of Wolves’ key performers pick up what could prove to be a serious problem. The player in question is Raul Jimenez, with the Mexican having been involved in a sickening clash of heads with David Luiz just minutes into the action. Whilst the latter was eventually able to carry on after being tended to by the Arsenal medical team, Jimenez was forced off in concerning fashion, after seemingly being knocked out cold. The Wolves hitman will likely be taken straight to hospital, with an update on the situation expected at some point over the coming hours. 16′ | #ARS 0-0 #WOL Raul Jimenez is stretchered from the field after he and David Luiz clash heads inside the Wolves box.
