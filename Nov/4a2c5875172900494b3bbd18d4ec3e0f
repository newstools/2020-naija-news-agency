Claims stemming from the English media over the last 24 hours suggest that Tottenham have been handed the chance to re-sign Christian Eriksen. Danish international Eriksen of course brought his 7-year Spurs spell to an end back in January. After coming to the decision not to renew his expiring contract with the north Londoners, the 28-year-old made the move to Serie A giants Inter Milan, in a cut-price deal. At the time, Eriksen’s addition was understandably viewed as quite a coup for Inter, with the Dane having long stood as one of the Premier League’s most productive midfielders. To say that his time at the San Siro has since not gone according to plan, though, would be putting it lightly. Eriksen has majorly struggled to win over the ever-bullish Antonio Conte. As things stand, the likes of Nicolo Barella, Marcelo Brozovic and summer arrival Arturo Vidal all sit ahead of the former Ajax man in the pecking order of the Nerazzurri boss. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1202956224-1024x665.jpg?resize=1024%2C665&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1202956224-1024x665.jpg?resize=1024%2C665&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1202956224-1024x665.jpg?resize=1024%2C665&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1202956224-1024x665.jpg?resize=1024%2C665&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 29: Christian Eriksen of FC Internazionale looks on during the Coppa Italia Quarter Final match between FC Internazionale and ACF Fiorentina at San Siro on January 29, 2020 in Milan, Italy.

As such, as Eriksen’s time in Milan inches towards its one-year anniversary, murmurs have begun to spread in the media that Inter could attempt to cut their losses during the January window. And, as outlined above, one club to have been tipped as a potential landing spot over the last 24 hours are none other than the midfielder’s ex-employers, Tottenham. As per a report from Football Insider, Spurs have been handed the chance to bring Eriksen back to the English capital: ‘A recruitment source has told Football Insider that intermediaries have offered Eriksen to his former club Spurs as well as other leading Premier League sides.’ Interestingly, it as added that Inter would even be willing to allow the out-of-favour Dane to depart on a loan basis, as the Nerazzurri chiefs attempt to trim the club’s hefty wage bill. Taking a chance on Eriksen’s signing with no attached fee would no doubt represent an enticing option for a number of clubs, though it remains to be seen if Jose Mourinho’s Lilywhites could emerge as one such suitor.
