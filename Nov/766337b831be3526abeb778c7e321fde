Word stemming from the German media on Friday suggests that Chelsea are readying an imminent swoop for Bayern Munich star David Alaba. Austrian stopper Alaba has of course long stood as a key cog in the success of Bundesliga champions Bayern. The 28-year-old has spent his entire senior career to date on the books of the Bavarians, since making the move to Munich from his home country in 2009. Alaba possesses a whole host of talents, boasting pace to burn, athleticism, an eye for a pass, superb crossing technique and a hammer of a left foot. In turn, for some time, the 75-time capped international was widely considered to be the best left-back in world football. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-655222214-1024x665.jpg" alt="Andreas Christensen"/> MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY – MARCH 19: David Alaba of Bayern Munich is challenged by Andreas Christensen of Borussia Moenchengladbach during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayern Muenchen at Borussia-Park on March 19, 2017 in Moenchengladbach, Germany.

The Austrian, whilst a full-back by trade, is more than capable of lining out in the middle of the park, and, since the emergence of Alphonso Davies at the Allianz Arena, has actually spent the majority of his time at centre-half. All told, Alaba has racked up well over 350 appearances for Bayern, securing 23 trophies along the way, including 9 Bundesliga titles and a pair of Champions League crowns. As such, it has no doubt come as a major source of concern for all associated with the German champions to see Alaba’s current deal in Munich continue to wind down. As things stand, the versatile stopper is due to be become a free agent in the summer of 2021, having failed to come to an agreement on the terms of a fresh contract. This comes amid claims of frankly outlandish financial demands on the part of the 28-year-old. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1055539040-1024x683.jpg" alt="‘Plan to start talks in January’ – David Alaba to Chelsea links ramp up"/> ROEDINGHAUSEN, GERMANY – OCTOBER 30: Players, David Alaba, Meritan Shabani, Thomas Mueller, Sandro Wagner, Javi Martinez and Niklas Suele of Bayern Muenchen clebrtae vicotry after the DFB Cup match between SV Rodinghausen and FC Bayern Munich at Hacker-Wiehenstadion on October 30, 2018 in Roedinghausen, Germany.

Recent months have seen the likes of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Juventus all tipped as potential landing spots for the Bayern star. As outlined above, however, it is yet another suitor who are now said to be ready to strike upon the opening of the winter window. The outfit in question? Chelsea. As per a report from Christian Falk of German outlet SportBild, the Blues will open negotiations with Alaba’s agent in January, in an attempt to reach a pre-contract agreement with the Austrian. Alaba would presumably be brought to Stamford Bridge to line out at either centre-half or in the middle of the park, with Ben Chilwell set to lock down the left-back berth in Frank Lampard’s first-choice XI over the seasons to come. Also said to be readying a swoop for the experienced defender, meanwhile, are French champions PSG.
