Reports doing the rounds in the English media on Friday suggest that Georginio Wijnaldum is inching ever closer to the Liverpool exit door. Dutch international Wijnaldum has been on the books of Liverpool since the summer of 2016. And, despite his arrival from Premier League rivals Newcastle having initially gone somewhat under the radar, the 30-year-old has gone on to establish himself as an absolutely integral member of Jurgen Klopp’s midfield over the years since. Wijnaldum has started no less than 27 league games in each of his 4 seasons at Anfield, including all but three of the Reds’ league fixtures en route to English top-flight glory in 2019/20. The Feyenoord youth product’s brace in Liverpool’s stunning Champions League semi-final comeback versus Barcelona last year, meanwhile, saw Wijnaldum etch his name indellibly into club folklore. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1147626567-1024x683.jpg"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – MAY 07: Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool celebrates after scoring his team’s third goal with Trent Alexander-Arnold during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final second leg match between Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield on May 07, 2019 in Liverpool, England.

This comes with the all-action midfielder’s contract at Anfield due to expire next summer, and new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman known to have been keen on the services of his fellow countryman during the summer: Gini Wijnaldum remains Ronald Koeman’s first choice target for Barcelona but a deal with Liverpool is “complicated”. [@FabrizioRomano] — Anfield Edition (@AnfieldEdition) September 14, 2020 And, as outlined above, if the latest word stemming from the media this evening is to be believed, then the chances of Wijnaldum staying put on Merseyside appear to be fading by the day. This comes amid claims that Liverpool are now ‘resigned’ to losing their midfield star. As per the reliable James Pearce of The Athletic, Wijnaldum’s situation at Anfield ‘has not changed’ for some time now, with a free agent departure in the summer of 2022 looking increasingly likely. Significantly, despite the club’s abundance of talent in the middle of the park, it is also suggested that, should the Dutchman move on, Jurgen Klopp and co. will likely seek out a replacement. .@JamesPearceLFC: “Every week that goes by, the chances of Gini Wijnaldum staying beyond this season recede. #lfc seemed resigned to him leaving on a free next summer and I’m not aware the situation has changed since. I’d expect LFC to sign a replacement.” #awlfc [the athletic] pic.twitter.com/zrk9BRRAJz — Anfield Watch (@AnfieldWatch) November 20, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
