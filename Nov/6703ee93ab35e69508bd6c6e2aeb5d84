I come from a city where there were a lot of crises, violence, people killing each other, and stuffs so my song 'Hello Brother' was like me reaching out to not just my city but the world, it was me reaching out from my heart to everyone in the world that yo! you are my brother, despite the colour or anything, you are still my brother and I love you. So I think that's actually my favorite song still.
