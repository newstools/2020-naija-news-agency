Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has, on Monday, provided his take on the club’s ‘tough’ October, after bagging his latest Player of the Month award. Last month, from an individual standpoint, proved a fine one for English international Rashford. The attacker was again widely praised for his work away from the pitch, as Rashford continues to push towards bringing an end to child food poverty in the UK. His displays on the pitch, meanwhile, also proved none-too-shabby, with the 23-year-old having impressed for both club and country. Whilst on international duty, Rashford netted the opener for England, as Gareth Southgate’s men downed world no.1 Belgium in a Nations League clash. Elsewhere, across 5 appearances for Man United, he managed to directly contribute to 7 goals. The standout displays came in Europe, when, after first lashing home a late winner in Paris to down PSG, Rashford later bagged a hat-trick versus RB Leipzig, despite only featuring for the game’s final half-hour. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229189362-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s English Forward Marcus Rashford (R) celebrates after scoring a goal during the UEFA Europa League Group H first-leg football match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Manchester United at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on October 20, 2020.

The Englishman was photographed with his latest accolade earlier today: @MarcusRashford with his #MUFC Player of the Month award for October  pic.twitter.com/NOLCSUlDod — Manchester United (@ManUtd) November 2, 2020 As outlined above, though, Rashford, despite impressing on an individual basis, has been left with altogether mixed feelings regarding October. This comes with the Red Devils having managed wins in just one of their three Premier League outings, a stretch which included a 6-1 drubbing at home to Tottenham. Speaking in an interview with United’s official website, Rashford therefore admitted that recent weeks have proven ‘tough’ at Old Trafford, before urging his teammates to ‘get back to the basics’, in a bid to turn their fortunes around: It’s been tough. Obviously, we’ve had a lot of big games and games we need to get points in. It’s been a bit up and down but it’s like that sometimes. Like you say, it’s been an alright month but, for now, it’s all about sticking together and finding a way to win games and really picking up the belief. “We always bounce back when we don’t do so well and I think it’s another one of those times. We have to come together as a team, get back to the basics, and win games.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
