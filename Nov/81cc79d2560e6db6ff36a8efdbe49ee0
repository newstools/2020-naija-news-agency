An update on the fitness of Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey has been forthcoming online on Saturday. Mikel Arteta’s men are of course set to return to Premier League action tomorrow night. The Gunners will welcome Nuno Espirito Santo’s Wolves to north London, for a highly anticipated clash. Arsenal head into proceedings desperate for all 3 points, having seen their positive early-season domestic form go up in smoke over recent weeks. The capital giants have managed just a solitary win across their last 5 Premier League outings, the latest of which saw Arteta’s outfit lucky to escape Elland Road with a share of the spoils last weekend. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229539898-1024x715.jpg" alt="Insight into Thomas Partey’s fitness provided ahead of Arsenal’s meeting with Wolves"/> Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on the touchline during the Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, London.

One such player was Thomas Partey. Summer addition Partey was forced off at half-time of the Gunners’ 3-0 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa prior to the international break, and has not featured for club or country since. There had been hope that the Ghanaian would return to fitness in time to feature versus Wolves on Sunday, in a much-needed boost for Mikel Arteta’s squad. If the latest word doing the rounds on social media on Saturday is to be believed, however, then this will in fact not prove the case. As per a report from the highly reliable AFC Bell, Partey has not yet returned to outdoor training. This comes with the former Atletico Madrid man in the midst of a ‘precautionary treatment plan’, to ensure a flare up to his existing problem is not forthcoming. Partey himself is said to feel ‘ready’ to return to the pitch, but will not be risked when Arsenal welcome Wolves to the Emirates on Sunday. توماس بارتي لم يتدرب على العشب بعد، الفريق الطبي وضعه تحت خطة علاجية احترازية للتأكد من سلامة موضع الإصابة من أي تفاقم غير مُتوقع حال عودته للتشكيلة. توماس يشعر بأنه جاهز وأن وضعه يتحسّن عن ذي قبل مع مرور الأيام لكن النادي لن يخاطر بإشراكه دون الإطمئنان ١٠٠٪ لحالته البدنية. — TheAFCBell (@TheAFCBeII) November 28, 2020 *Update* – Arsenal themselves have since also provided an update on Partey, as follows: Left thigh.
