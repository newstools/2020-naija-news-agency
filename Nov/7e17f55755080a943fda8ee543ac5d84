Manchester United’s first signing of the summer saw them snap up Donny van de Beek from Ajax. The Red Devils are believed to have paid an initial £35m to bring the midfielder to Old Trafford, which seems a pretty reasonable fee for such a solid player in today’s market. However, despite being such a prolific figure for Ajax and the Dutch national team, van de Beek has found minutes hard to come by in Manchester. In fact, the 23-year-old is yet to start a single Premier League tie and has completed 90 minutes just once for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1201297169-1024x640.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JANUARY 22: Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of Manchester United walks off at half time during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Burnley FC at Old Trafford on January 22, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

But despite insisting the former Ajax star would get his games, van de Beek notched just 15 minutes of action in United’s following two league outings – not even getting off the bench vs Everton. As a result, van de Beek has inevitably been drawn on his lack of playing time since moving to Man United. Van de Beek stated he would like to play more, before also claiming he has already shown he can add something to the Man United team: “It sounds cliche for me to say this, because of course I would have liked to play more, but I really enjoy being in a nice team. I am simply received very well and helped by everyone. “I’m a patient person, but of course you go there to play as much as possible. I also think – in the minutes that I have made, in the times that I have come in – I have shown that I can add something to the team.” Quotes via Goal.
