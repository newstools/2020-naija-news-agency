Chelsea’s victory over Sheffield United this evening saw the club’s summer signings, and Hakim Ziyech in particular, thoroughly impress once more. Frank Lampard’s men welcomed the Blades to Stamford Bridge a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. Chelsea no doubt headed into proceedings brimming with confidence, on the back of a major upturn in form of late. Having managed to get the club’s defensive woes under control, in large part thanks to the influence of Thiago Silva and Edouard Mendy, the Blues remained unbeaten in their prior 7 outings across all competitions before today. This run included 5 consecutive clean sheets, and wins in their last 3. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class=" jetpack-lazy-image"><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><noscript><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1229376648-1024x667.jpg?resize=1024%2C667&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Chelsea’s Moroccan midfielder Hakim Ziyech (3R) celebrates scoring the opening goal during the English Premier League football match between Burnley and Chelsea at Turf Moor in Burnley, north west England on October 31, 2020.

As such, a comfortable 3 points was widely predicted for the hosts in southwest London this evening. And, when all was said and done, this is precisely what came to fruition. It was actually Sheffield United who opened the scoring in the clash, as Chris Wilder’s men were rewarded for an industrious opening to proceedings when David McGoldrick flicked a wonderful finish beyond the helpless Edouard Mendy. Chelsea, though, soon hit back. After Hakim Ziyech played Mateo Kovacic in over the top of the visitors’ backline, the Croat’s pull-back towards the edge of the box was slotted home by Tammy Abraham.

Ben Chilwell was the man on target on this occasion, as Ziyech’s devilish delivery to the back post was bundled home by the arriving left-back. The ensuing 40 minutes saw Chelsea continue to dominate in terms of both possession and chances created, but struggle to break down a resolute Blades backline. Any hope of an unlikely comeback on the part of Chris Wilder’s outfit, however, was firmly extinguished with a little less than a quarter of an hour remaining. Ziyech was again the creator, whipping a pinpoint free-kick onto the head of Thiago Silva, who made no mistake in nodding beyond the frustrated Aaron Ramsdale. And there was still time for another of the home side’s attackers to get in on the act, as Timo Werner reacted quickest to an unfortunate ricochet to burst through on goal, before slotting home at the near post in typically clinical fashion.

Recent arrivals at the club played key roles in all 4 of Chelsea’s goals today. Ziyech essentially created the first with his defence-splitting pass for Kovacic, before teeing up fellow summer recruits Chilwell and Silva for the home side’s 2nd and 3rd. THIAGO SILVA SCORES!

Much was of course made of Chelsea’s recent big-money recruitment drive, as the capital giants took full advantage of the lack of funds available at other top European clubs to bag 7 new players. The decisions to bring in the likes of the aging Silva and relatively unproven Mendy were inevitably questioned by fans and pundits alike, with it of course having been altogether unclear what kind of impact the latest arrivals in southwest London would have. On the back of a hit-and-miss start, though, a clearer picture is beginning to develop. And to say that it is an encouraging one from a Chelsea standpoint would be putting it lightly. Lampard’s new-look side are no joke, and whether it comes this season or next, the Blues will unquestionably soon mount an all-out assault for the Premier League title.
