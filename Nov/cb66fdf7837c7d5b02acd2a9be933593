The first part of the interview was released on Youtube on November 2, 2020. When asked how growing up was for her, especially being close to her mom. Tiwa expressed: I found it hard initially, I didn't really like her because she was tough on me. I was really close to her, I could tell her things that you shouldn't be able to tell a Nigerian mom. I was trying to bleach because I hated my dark skin, she caught me and threw everything away, I was between 14 and 16, I was really insecure. While talking about her high school experiences in London, she expressed how she attempted suicide twice for being bullied and depressed. She said It was really bad, I tried killing myself two times, I was really depressed, I was really bullied. They will flush my head down the toilet during lunch break. I had to have like a police escort me sometimes because after school they will brush me on the bus like gang of girls. It was really bad. The bullying went on for 3 – 4 years. Tiwa further expressed how she started singing at 15 years old because she wanted to get the attention of a guy she was crushing on in high school. In her words: Then their was a guy I had a crush on and he use to hang around with these girls, then they will just sing songs. So I went to my music teacher, there was a school play, sound of music and I wanted to audition, he was aww, auditions are done. I was like Sir, no I really really think I can do it. So he gave me a song, told me to go home and practice, I came back and he looked at me, you can actually sing. That's where everything changed. I did that and i got the role, I was one of the children in sound of music and everybody was like woooh and then they become my friends. Someone in my school was like I know some agent that is looking for backup singers. The first I got was to sing backup for George Michael and I was still in secondary school and I was telling everyone that I was going to sing for George Michael and they all watched it on TV and over the weekend, I got back to school on Monday and I was literally like a star.
