Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has this evening provided an update on Marcus Rashfordâ€™s fitness, after the English international was left out of the clubâ€™s squad to take on Liverpool. The Red Devils are currently locked in action with Jurgen Kloppâ€™s table-toppers, in a Premier League meeting. Liverpool of course entered the clash as overwhelming favourites to emerge victorious, amid a historic spell of form. To this point in the Premier League campaign, the Merseysiders have dropped points on just a solitary occasion. This run, coupled with the inconsistencies of the rest of the English top-flightâ€™s heavyweights, saw Liverpool head into this eveningâ€™s proceedings 13 points clear of 2nd-placed Manchester City, with 2 games in hand. United, on the other hand, sat 5th in the Premier League table before today. Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s men, though, were aware ahead of kick-off that a win would see them move to within 2 points of 4th-placed Chelsea. As is customary, an hour prior to proceedings getting underway at Anfield, the starting line-ups of both sides were made official. Jurgen Klopp set hosts Liverpool up as follows: ðŸ”´ TEAM NEWS ðŸ”´ Our line-up to face @ManUtd ðŸ‘Š â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) January 19, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Manchester Unitedâ€™s XI, meanwhile, is showcased below: ðŸš¨ TEAM NEWS ðŸš¨ Hereâ€™s your #MUFC starting XI for #LIVMUNâ€¦ â€” Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 19, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Evidently, one glaring omission from the XI fielded by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this evening came in the form of Marcus Rashford. English international Rashford was forced off with a back problem during Manchester Unitedâ€™s FA Cup victory over Wolves during the week, and had since been viewed as a doubt to feature at Anfield today. As such, speaking ahead of kick-off, Red Devils boss Solskjaer was inevitably drawn on his star attackerâ€™s absence, as well as when fans can expect to see Rashford return to action. It was far from positive news regarding Unitedâ€™s top-scorer, though, with Solskjaer having explained: â€˜It was the knock he got against Wolves. It was bad enough to keep him out. Weâ€™ll have to keep monitoring him and see how he is.â€™ â€˜He got a couple of knocks vs Wolves. Aggravated his back. [We need to] give him time to recover before we put him back on the pitch. I wouldnâ€™t expect him to be back in the next few weeks. We have a mid-season break and Iâ€™m not sure are going to see him before then.â€™ https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Liverpool vs Manchester United live streaming: Watch the Premier League online & confirmed line-ups Man United â€˜baulkâ€™ at Sportingâ€™s valuation of Bruno Fernandes â€“ Guardian Source: Great Goals Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho this evening took aim at current Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with a typically-ruthless jibe.
