Jody Morris has this evening provided an update on the future of out-of-favour Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud, amid widespread speculation that he could be on the move this month. 33-year-old hitman Giroud has been on the books at Stamford Bridge since January of 2018. After Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s arrival at Arsenal pushed the Frenchman further down the attacking pecking order of the Gunners, Chelsea swooped to secure Giroud’s signature on deadline day. And the veteran has since gone on to rotate in-and-out of the Blues’ starting XI, amid a number of changes in management. Giroud’s most telling contribution to the Chelsea cause came last season in Europe, when the World Cup winner notched a hugely-impressive 11 goals and 4 assists en route to Europa League glory. ⚽️🥇 2018/19 top scorer… 🔵 Olivier Giroud 😘🏆#UELfinal | @ChelseaFC pic.twitter.com/m2uSE250bO — UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) May 30, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js To this point in the current campaign, though, Giroud has majorly struggled for game-time. New Pensioners boss Frank Lampard has settled firmly on Tammy Abraham as his first-choice centre-forward, with Michy Batshuayi also ahead of Giroud in the attacking pecking order at Stamford Bridge. This has seen the former Arsenal man notch just 2 starts across all competitions thus far in 2019/20. As such, rumours of late have inevitably seen Giroud linked with a potential exit from Stamford Bridge. The likes of Crystal Palace, Lyon and Inter Milan have all been named as possible January destinations for the Frenchman. Reports stemming from France over the last 48 hours, meanwhile, have hinted at Giroud’s potential involvement in a swap deal involving Lyon star Moussa Dembele. As such, speaking in a press conference a short time ago, Chelsea assistant manager Jody Morris, who was standing in for the ill Frank Lampard, was drawn on Giroud’s future. The Blues coach, though, was keen not to give too much away, assuring that Giroud remains ‘a valuable asset’ to the club: ‘He still plays for Chelsea.’ ‘We can’t just let players walk out the door if we’re going to be short somewhere.’ ‘We need to look at individuals but he’s been a class act and a top professional. I don’t envisage there being any problems in that regard.’ ‘Everyone is valuable. We’ve viewed every single player as a valuable asset. You never know what can happen with injuries or form.’ Quotes via Goal Jody Morris provides Chelsea team news update ahead of Nottingham Forest Wolves vs Manchester United betting tips: FA Cup Third Round match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Reports across the English media this afternoon suggest that Crystal Palace are eyeing a January swoop for out-of-favour Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud.
