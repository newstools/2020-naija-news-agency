Updates on a pair of potential outgoings from Stamford Bridge towards the San Siro have been forthcoming online this evening. Links between Chelsea hitman Olivier Giroud and Serie A giants Inter Milan have been rampant throughout the January transfer window. This comes with the Frenchman majorly struggling for game-time to this point in the campaign, and Nerazzurri boss Antonio Conte on the lookout for reinforcements in attack. As such, a move to the San Siro for Giroud appears to make sense for all parties.

Wing-back Moses previously played a starring role under Conte at Stamford Bridge, en route to the Premier League title in 2017. And, after spending the opening half of the current campaign out on loan at Fenerbahce, the Nigerian international now looks all set to reunite with his former boss at the San Siro. Speaking during the same media exchange in which he provided an update on the possibility of signing Giroud, Piero Ausilio confirmed that Inter have reached an agreement to bring Moses in this month: Ausilio (Inter sport director) to @SkySport: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve reached an agreement with Chelsea for Victor Moses. Giroud is a possibility if we‚Äôll sell one striker on this transfer market‚Äù. üîµ #CFC #Chelsea #Inter ‚Äî Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 20, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The reliable Nizaar Kinsella has since provided further details on the Moses deal: Victor Moses is set for a reunion with Antonio Conte ü§ù Inter are closing in on a loan deal until the end of the season with a ‚Ç¨10 million option to buy üí∞ ‚úçÔ∏è @NizaarKinsella ‚Äî Goal News (@GoalNews) January 20, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Chelsea vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Sheffield United vs Manchester City betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Giroud struggling for game time Olivier Giroud has been on Chelsea‚Äôs books for close to two years now.
