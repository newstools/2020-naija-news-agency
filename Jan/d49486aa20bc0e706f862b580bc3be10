Watford would play host to League One outfit Tranmere on Saturday in an FA Cup 3rd round clash. The Hornets form has taken a dramatic upturn since Nigel Pearson took the reins at the back end of last year. The relegation-battling side are undefeated in their last four Premier League outings, picking up wins over Manchester United, Wolves and Aston Villa. The remaining tie was a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United. As for Tranmere, they are languishing at the wrong end of the League One table. Rather unsurprisingly, given the sides contrasting form and the fact Watford are two leagues above Tranmere, it would be Pearson’s side who dominated the opening exchanges, going in at half-time with a commanding 3-0 lead. However, Tranmere fought valiantly in the second 45 with the League One side earning a 3-3 draw and a replay at their ground. As well as blowing a three-goal lead vs lower-league opposition, Watford were dealt another blow on Saturday as Roberto Pereyra was shown a straight red card in the 89th minute. That red should have seen the Argentine miss Watford’s next three ties, the first being away to Bournemouth on Sunday in the Premier League. With the Cherries just one point above Watford in the Premier League table, Sunday’s tie is a pivotal clash for both sides. Luckily for Watford, The FA have, on Tuesday the 7th of January, overturned Roberto Pereyra’s red card. We’ve successfully appealed against the red card shown to Roberto Pereyra against Tranmere Rovers on Saturday. That’s one fewer card for the birthday boy today — Watford Football Club (@WatfordFC) January 7, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js See also: Leicester vs Aston Villa betting tips: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg match preview & predictions Tottenham confirm major Moussa Sissoko injury blow  Source: Great Goals
