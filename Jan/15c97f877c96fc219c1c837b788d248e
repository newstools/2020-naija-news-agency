Man City boss Pep Guardiola has this afternoon provided a fitness update on his squad, ahead of their Manchester derby meeting with United. The Citizens are set to visit Old Trafford in a little over 24 hoursâ€™ time, for the first-leg of the clubâ€™s highly-anticipated Carabao Cup semi-final tie. The matchup comes as the 2nd Manchester derby in the space of the last month, with the historic rivals having also faced off in the Premier League on the 7th of December. On that occasion, it was visitors United who shocked the masses with a 2-1 win, courtesy of a pair of early strikes from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. It is City, though, who will head into proceedings tomorrow night in the better form of the two sides. Pep Guardiolaâ€™s men have racked up 3 straight wins across all competitions, the latest of which saw the Sky Blues secure their spot in the FA Cupâ€™s 4th-round with a 4-1 drubbing of Port Vale over the weekend. And Cityâ€™s hopes of carrying their fine recent form to Old Trafford have today been dealt a boost. Speaking in a press conference a short time ago, Pep Guardiola was asked for a fitness update on his squad. And the Spanish tactician went on to confirm that, aside from long-term injury absentee Leroy Sane, who is also well on the road to recovery, he has essentially a full-fit squad to choose from: PEP ðŸ’¬ Weâ€™ve played an incredible amount of games and some players need to rest. I have an idea of how weâ€™re going to play but I still donâ€™t know who will play tomorrow. Everyone apart from Leroy is training. We almost have a full squad. Itâ€™s good. â€” Manchester City (@ManCity) January 6, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Manchester United vs Manchester City betting tips: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg match preview & predictions Manchester City & Man United linked with Harry Winks Source: Great Goals
