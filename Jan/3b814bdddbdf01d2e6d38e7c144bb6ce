The ladies in question promised him money and another thing he wants just for him to agree to their requests. A very irritated Omashola took to his Twitter page to warn the ladies from sending him such images and also threatened to reveal their identities. Apostle Chris also stated that he is a changed man as no amount of money can make him turn his back on God.
