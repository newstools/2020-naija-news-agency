Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has this afternoon revealed why Danny Rose was not part of the club’s matchday squad to take on Watford. Mourinho’s men visited Vicarage Road a short time ago, for a meeting with the in-form Hornets. Watford entered proceedings on the back of 4 wins from their last 5 Premier League outings. Tottenham, on the other hand, had managed just a solitary victory from their last 5 across all competitions. As such, it came as little surprise when the north Londoners failed to get things back on track this afternoon. A feisty affair at Vicarage Road, during which both sides went close over the course of the 90 minutes, eventually saw Watford and Spurs forced to settle for a point apiece. This is how close Spurs were from taking the lead in injury time 💀 Jeez. pic.twitter.com/ycUQgiHk2f — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) January 18, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As such, if Chelsea manage to put Newcastle to the sword in today’s late Premier League kick-off, Tottenham will have slipped a likely-insurmountable 11 points adrift of their capital rivals in the race for a top-4 berth. Speaking in a press conference on the back of his side’s latest disappointing result, Jose Mourinho since opened up on a number of topics, including the notable absence of one of Spurs’ stars this afternoon. The north Londoners took to the pitch at Vicarage Road without Danny Rose, with the stopper having not even been part of the club’s matchday squad. Mourinho, though, has since confirmed that Rose picked up a fitness problem in training on Thursday, with the 29-year-old having been left out as a precautionary measure as a result: Mourinho confirms the absence of Danny Rose at Vicarage Road was due to a problem he sustained in training on Thursday. “He had a little injury in his back two days ago so I decided to only bring fit players.” 🚑 https://t.co/4KiAUTZjCa#COYS — Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) January 18, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Tottenham continue to struggle without Kane as they earn rare clean sheet vs Watford Newcastle vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
