Numerous reports across the English media today have confirmed Jesse Lingard’s decision to hire notorious agent Mino Raiola as his new representative. Manchester United star Lingard’s struggles over the last 12 months have been widely-documented in the media and beyond. The English international has continued to play a prominent role in the Red Devils’ first-team setup since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s appointment late in 2018. Lingard is often utilised as the link between midfield and attack in United’s XI, over the likes of Juan Mata. As such, a player handed a free role for one of European football’s heavyweights would understandably be expected to provide a spark in attacking areas, as well as chipping in with at least the odd goal and assist. This, though, has proven far from the case for the struggling Lingard. Incredibly, 28 Premier League appearances over the course of the calendar year of 2019 saw the 27-year-old fail to notch a single direct goal involvement. 28 games. 0 goals. 0 assists.

The likes of James Maddison, Jack Grealish and Bruno Fernandes have all been named as January targets of Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As such, if United do manage to clinch a deal for one of the aforementioned trio, or another attack-minded midfielder over the coming weeks, Jesse Lingard is likely to see his game-time take a serious hit. And, if the Englishman’s latest actions are anything to go by, then Lingard appears to be planning ahead for such a scenario. As outlined above, the Manchester United youth product has hired a new agent, in the form of the ever-controversial Mino Raiola. Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard will now be represented by super-agent Mino Raiola. 🤝🔴 Follow all the latest #TransferTalk in our live blog below or watch Good Morning Transfers on Sky Sports News now! — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) January 6, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Could this signal Lingard eyeing a potential departure from Old Trafford in the near future? It should be noted that Mino Raiola tore into those in charge at Man United in a ruthless rant just last week, when discussing the situation of his most high-profile Red Devils client, Paul Pogba: ‘I wouldn’t take anyone there. They would even ruin [Diego] Maradona, Pele and [Paolo] Maldini.’ ‘Pogba’s problem is Manchester United. It’s a club out of touch with reality and without a sporting project.’ ‘Paul needs a club and a squad, one like Juventus was before.’ Manchester City & Man United linked with Harry Winks Manchester United vs Manchester City betting tips: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
