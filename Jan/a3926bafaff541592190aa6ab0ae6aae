As per a report from the Telegraph, Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan squad are hopeful that the club will opt to make Alexis Sanchez’s loan from Manchester United permanent come the summer. Chilean international Sanchez made the move to Manchester in January of 2018, on the back of a scintillating stint with Premier League rivals Arsenal. To say that the 31-year-old’s time at Old Trafford subsequently proved disappointing, though, would be an understatement. Sanchez, simply put, failed to deliver in any way, shape or form in a Red Devils jersey. All told, last season saw the experienced South American notch a paltry 2 goals across all competitions.

As such, it came as little surprise when the former Barcelona man’s departure was made official late in August. Sanchez joined Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan on loan for the remainder of the 2019/20 campaign, reuniting with Romelu Lukaku at the San Siro: 🛑 | EVERYONE STOP 🥂 @Alexis_Sanchez is a Nerazzurri player! 🇨🇱⚫🔵 👉🏻 https://t.co/4mJAFMukTV#WelcomeAlexis #NotForEveryone #FCIM pic.twitter.com/zJ0jyuhG99 — Inter (@Inter_en) August 29, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The attacker’s time in Milan, though, has since also proven a major disappointment. Sanchez actually enjoyed a decent start to life in the Nerazzurri jersey, notching a goal and an assist across his first 4 appearances. However, just when he appeared to be getting things back on track, a serious injury picked up whilst on international duty in October saw Sanchez confined to the sidelines. The 31-year-old damaged ankle ligaments during a friendly meeting between Chile and Colombia, and has since managed just a solitary appearance. 🏥 | ESAMI Accertamenti clinici e strumentali per @Alexis_Sanchez: il comunicato 👉 https://t.co/0Z09tcBLiJ #FCIM pic.twitter.com/1D6zzeHNRN — Inter (@Inter) October 15, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As per the aforementioned report from the Telegraph, though, despite his lack of game-time, Sanchez’s Inter teammates want to see the Man United man’s loan made permanent. Sanchez is said to be a popular figure in the dressing room of the Milanese giants, and has continued to bond with Antonio Conte’s squad during his time on the sidelines. The South American’s transfer potentially becoming permanent, though, will of course depend on a number of factors, namely his form over the second-half of the campaign, and the kind of sum that Manchester United would demand for Sanchez’s signature.
