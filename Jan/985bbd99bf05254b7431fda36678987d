The lady got pregnant and gave birth to a daughter who is said to be Davido’s daughter. After initially denying the fact that he slept with her, the singer allegedly confessed that he and his gang including B-Red did have relations with her. However, the “Risky” singer has refused to acknowledge, the child, Anu as his first child. Kemi revealed that she has been the one taking care of the child and her mother since 2018 since Davido refused to help. She also added that all she wants is a new DNA test in order to if she, Anu was fathered by Davido or B-Red. “Davido admitted that his entire entourage slept with Ayo Labinjoh February 2013 after a concert and a bar visit to where she worked. BRed Bayo Adeleke, Late DJ Olu and Davido’s mgr all slept with her as I heard him on a set up conversation. Ayo Labinjoh has consistently stood by what happened during the night but a member of a Yoruba royal family called me to come see him, called Davido and put him on speaker. Davido said “we were young and reckless and we all slept with her.” “If Davido would agree to take his new DNA test and comes positive then the order of baby mama and children will be rearranged as Anu, Imade and Hayley, Ifeanyi. Good luck to them all. I’ve done my part. If she belongs to Bayo, it means he has two children” THREAD: THE RECKLESS LIFE DAVID ADELEKE STARTED.
