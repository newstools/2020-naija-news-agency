Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has spoken out over the future of star striker Moussa Dembele, amid rumours that the Frenchman is a January target for Premier League giants Chelsea. 23-year-old hitman Dembele made a return to his home country in the summer of 2018, when the Frenchman joined Lyon from Celtic for â‚¬22 million. And, on the back of an impressive stint with the Scottish champions, Dembele has since gone on to carry his goalscoring exploits back to Ligue 1. The powerful attackerâ€™s debut season at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais saw him rack up 20 goals and 6 assists across all competitions.

Reports earlier this season saw Manchester United heavily-linked with a swoop for Dembele. Duncan Castles even went as far as to claim that contact has already been established with Lyon on the part of the Red Devils: â€˜I can tell you there has been contact between Manchester United and individuals close to Moussa Dembele to assess the playerâ€™s interest in the move and to work out what the cost would be in terms of salary.â€™ The latest speculation across Europe, though, has seen another of the Premier Leagueâ€™s giants named as fellow suitors of Dembele. The outfit in question? Chelsea. Sky recently claimed that the Blues are strongly considering a move for the Lyon hitman this winter. BREAKING: Chelsea are considering a move to sign Lyon striker Moussa Dembele. â€” Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) December 31, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js This comes with both Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi tipped to depart Stamford Bridge this month, in search of regular playing time ahead of next summerâ€™s European Championships. If the latest comments on the part of Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas are anything to go by, though, then Dembele will be going nowhere over the coming weeks. Speaking in an interview with OLâ€™s official website, Aulas was questioned on the future of his clubâ€™s young hitman. And, despite confirming that bids have indeed been forthcoming for Dembele, the Lyon patron assured that the Frenchman himself has no intention of moving on: â€˜Moussa DembÃ©lÃ© will not leave because he wants to stay to win something with Lyon.â€™ â€˜There have been offers for him and for other players but none of those that we want to keep will leave in January.â€™ Quotes via talkSport Chelsea vs Burnley betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Manchester United vs Norwich betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Crystal Palace vs Arsenal betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals
