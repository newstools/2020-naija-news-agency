Norwich City boss Daniel Farke has this evening provided a fitness update on star striker Teemu Pukki. The Canaries are set to return to action tomorrow afternoon, with a Premier League meeting with Eddie Howeâ€™s Bournemouth at Carrow Road. The hosts will head into proceedings amid a dismal spell of form, having failed to secure a league victory since the end of November. Their latest outing, meanwhile, saw Norwich utterly dismantled en route to a 4-0 drubbing at Manchester United last weekend. This run has left the struggling Norfolk-based out sitting rock bottom of the English top-flight table, and staring relegation back to the Championship in the face. If Daniel Farkeâ€™s men maintain any hope of staging a miracle recovery over the coming months to maintain their top-flight status, though, then a 3-point haul this weekend will prove critical. The Canariesâ€™ opponents tomorrow, in the form of Bournemouth, sit 2nd from bottom in the Premier League. Eddie Howeâ€™s men have, like Norwich, been in absolutely abysmal form over recent weeks, with the Cherries set to visit Carrow Road on the back of consecutive defeats versus Brighton, West Ham and Watford, during which they conceded a whopping 10 goals, and scored none. As such, speaking in a press conference ahead of his sideâ€™s crunch meeting with Bournemouth, Daniel Farke this evening provided a fitness update on his squad. And, in a major boost to the hostsâ€™ prospects tomorrow, Farke confirmed that star striker Teemu Pukki is set to return to action. Finnish international Pukki has proven one of the few bright spots in Norwichâ€™s season to this point, having racked up 9 goals and 3 assists in the Premier League. However, the 29-year-old had missed the clubâ€™s last two outings with a hamstring problem. But, having returned to full fitness, both Pukki and key defender Ben Godfrey are once again available for selection: ðŸ’¬ DF: Teemu Pukki is ready to go and Ben Godfrey is back.#NORBOU pic.twitter.com/oLEkCO0iKF â€” Norwich City FC (@NorwichCityFC) January 17, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Newcastle vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Watford vs Tottenham betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions West Ham vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Manchester City vs Crystal Palace betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals Norwich City boss Daniel Farke has this afternoon confirmed that Teemu Pukki is set to miss the clubâ€™s FA Cup meeting with Preston, amid struggles with a pair of separate injury concerns.
