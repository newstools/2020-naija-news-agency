Davido is no doubt an hardworking artiste. In the past year, he’s revamped efforts to bring a naturalist feel to his music. At the higher levels of his obvious dedication to the craft, is him adapting songwriters; other times, Davido performs with a live band. For an artiste who isn’t known for his vocal prowess, Davido took a big risk (which paid off) by using a live band for his December show, titled after his sophomore album, A Good Time. At his largely successful show, Davido grandly walked out with live instrumentation, delivered in traditional Yoruba style. This stretches throughout the show, including a particular standout, where the DMW boss performed a classic song from his extensive catalog. The song, “Aye,” is Davido at his serenading best, one which we loved back in its days. Even now, it seems. OBO for sure, treated his audience to a live rendition of the timeless hit. And he came through with an excellent performance. .notjustok-artist-card-embed {
