Why? https://t.co/HJsjMRRb5Z — Vanessa Nakate (@vanessa_vash) January 24, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js According to BBC News, David Ake, AP’s Director of Photography, made a statement on the issue, pointing out that there was “no ill intent.” He wrote: The photographer was trying to get a picture out fast under tight deadline and cropped it purely on composition grounds because he thought the building in the background was distracting. When we went back to add more pictures to the report, which we almost always do when we are working under very tight deadlines, we added additional pictures with different crops. AP has since removed the cropped photo.
