There’s something happening now on social media, OAPs from a few popular media houses speaking out about the industry, how they’ve been treated in the past. Some radio stations have been name-called, (“Soundcity,” for instance) with the OAPs alleging ill treatment of staff, unpaid salaries, sexual harassment and that any staff that dared to complain the company got fired. It all started when @Mary_colette wrote about how some OAPs working with Soundcity got laid off because they went on a silent strike. Read her tweets. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1380636" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/C416E8B1-E22B-42D6-8EF9-C313847077D4.jpeg?resize=750%2C608&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="608" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1380637" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/48117CEE-30EC-4097-96C3-1914964A58FE.jpeg?resize=750%2C699&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="750" height="699" data-recalc-dims="1" /> An former OAP from Soundcity, Awazi Angbalaga (@THEAWAZI) replied her tweet thread saying: Lol this is not a joke Great platform aside Soundcity is easily the worst place I’ve ever worked in my life and this is taking unpaid internships into consideration The OAPs here are superheroes yet there constantly treated like shit.
