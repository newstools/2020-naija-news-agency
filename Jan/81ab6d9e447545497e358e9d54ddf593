Spurs have this evening confirmed that midfielder Moussa Sissoko is set for an extended spell on the sidelines, after being forced to undergo knee surgery. Jose Mourinho‚Äôs men visited St. Mary‚Äôs last Wednesday afternoon, for a Premier League meeting with Southampton. The north Londoners headed into the clash in search of a bounce-back performance, after being held to a disappointing 2-2 draw by bottom-of-the-table Norwich in their preceding outing. When the 90 minutes were said and done, however, Spurs failed to get back on track. A dismal performance on the part of the visitors eventually saw Southampton emerge with all 3 points. A solitary Danny Ings strike with 17 minutes on the clock proved the difference between the sides, as Tottenham‚Äôs top-4 hopes were dealt a blow. The result at St. Mary‚Äôs, however, was far from the only concern for the Lilywhites. After Tanguy Ndombele was forced off early on, Harry Kane followed suit 20 minutes from time. It has since been confirmed that Kane is set for an extended spell out of action, after tearing his hamstring.

An announcement across the social media platforms of the north Londoners has revealed that Moussa Sissoko was today forced to undergo surgery, after picking up an MCL issue last week. The French international is, as a result, expected to remain on the sidelines until April at the earliest.
