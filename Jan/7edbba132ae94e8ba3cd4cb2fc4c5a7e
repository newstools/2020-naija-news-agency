Watford boss Nigel Pearson has this evening provided a fitness update on the clubâ€™s squad, ahead of their meeting with Tottenham. The Hornets are set to welcome Jose Mourinhoâ€™s men to Vicarage Road on Saturday afternoon, for the weekendâ€™s Premier League opener. The hosts will head into proceedings brimming with confidence, on the back of a remarkable upturn in form since Nigel Pearsonâ€™s appointment. Watford have secured 4 wins and a draw from the clubâ€™s last 5 league outings, the latest of which saw them put Bournemouth to the sword by 3 goals to nil at the Vitality last weekend. This run of form has seen Nigel Pearsonâ€™s men jump from dead bottom of the English top-flight table to 17th in a matter of weeks, with the Hornets looking likely to continue their ascent over the coming months. As outlined above, meanwhile, next up for the Vicarage Road outfit is a meeting with Jose Mourinhoâ€™s Tottenham this weekend. Watford will no doubt fancy their chances of continuing their recent resurgence on Saturday, with Spurs having managed just a solitary victory from their last 5 across all competitions. And, ahead of his sideâ€™s meeting with the north Londoners, Nigel Pearson has this evening provided a fitness update on his squad. Speaking in a press conference a short time ago, the Hornets boss revealed the latest on all of Will Hughes, Kiko Femenia, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley. However, Pearson confirmed that though all of the quartet are making good progress in their respective recoveries from injury, none will be available this weekend. In some positive news for Watford, though, it was added that January arrival Ignacio Pussetto is in contention to make his debut versus Spurs: â€˜Probably, yes. Heâ€™s fitted in very well. Heâ€™s a very likeable young man. He speaks decent English and Iâ€™ve had a good chat with him. Heâ€™s settled in very quickly and gives us options in wide areas. Weâ€™ve seen during recent games weâ€™ve played with a lot of pace and variance in wide areas and he gives us another option there.â€™ Who do you want to see involved on Saturday against @SpursOfficial?
