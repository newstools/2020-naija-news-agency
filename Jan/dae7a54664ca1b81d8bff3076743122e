Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has provided fitness updates on Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw, ahead of the club’s upcoming meeting with Wolves. Solskjaer’s men welcomed bottom of the table Norwich to Old Trafford over the weekend, for a Premier League clash. The Red Devils headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back performance, on the back of a 3-match winless streak across all competitions. The latest of those came last Tuesday night, when United were deservedly downed by 3 goals to 1 by Man City in the League Cup semi-final first-leg between the clubs. When all was said and done in Manchester on Saturday afternoon, however, the hosts got back on track, and in style. A dominant showing from United eventually saw them romp to a 4-0 victory. Marcus Rashford proved the star of the show, bagging a brace in less than an hour on the pitch, with Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood having also been on target. 🔴 Marcus Rashford has been involved in 17 PL goals (13 goals, 4 assists) this season, a new career best, surpassing his total of 16 last season 👏 pic.twitter.com/n1pD71ZzoO — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) January 11, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js While their result versus Norwich evidently proved of a positive nature for United, however, they were also forced to deal with a couple of issues on the personnel front. First, Luke Shaw was a late scratch from the Red Devils’ matchday squad. 🚨 A late change to the #MUFC bench: ➡️ @TahithC

As such, speaking ahead of his side’s next outing, an FA Cup replay with Wolves on Wednesday night, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was asked for an update on Shaw’s fitness, as well as his potential involvement in 2 days’ time. And the Norwegian went on to explain: ‘He didn’t feel right. He’s been ill. So, for me, fine; go home. Hopefully, he’ll be ready for Wednesday.’ Solskjaer was then also asked about Marcus Rashford’s fitness, after the in-form attacker was withdrawn before the hour-mark on Saturday. On whether or not the English international is likely to feature versus Wolves, Solskjaer continued: ‘I don’t know. If he’s ready, and if I decide to play him, you’ll see. He’s played many games and I might have to look at it and see how we can manage him. But, we’ve got a week off very soon – in February.’ Quotes via Man United’s official website.
