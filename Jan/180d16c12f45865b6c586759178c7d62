Transition Committee Chairman, Osisioma Ngwa council, Dr. Ikechukwu Nwabeke, who stated this while inspecting buildings along Nicolas Street by Brass junction in Aba, said most landlords in the area had failed to provide soak away pits for tenants residing in the buildings. Nwabeke explained that such unhygienic practices could cause  disease outbreak in the council and urged health officials to ensure strict supervision of the area to promote healthy living. “Some landlords channelled their waste pipes to the gutters because they have failed to provide soak away pits in their buildings. This is capable of causing disease outbreak in the area. We are giving them one week ultimatum to build soak away pits or face the full wrath of the law,” he said. The chairman handed a week ultimatum to defaulting landlords to build septic tanks in their houses or face the wrath of the law.
