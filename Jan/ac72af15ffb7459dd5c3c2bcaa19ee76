Liverpool were this evening dealt a blow on the injury front, as Naby Keita was forced to sit out the club‚Äôs meeting with Sheffield United. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men welcomed the Blades to Anfield a short time ago, for their latest Premier League outing. The Reds headed into proceedings sitting pretty atop the English top-flight, with a hefty 10-point advantage over 2nd-placed Leicester City. Incredibly, this came despite Liverpool having held 2 games in hand over the rest of the chasing pack. And, when all was said and done on Merseyside tonight, the European champions‚Äô march towards domestic glory rolled on. Yet another dominant showing on the part of the hosts eventually saw Liverpool emerge with a 2-0 victory. Star attackers Mo Salah and Sadio Mane bagged the goals for Klopp‚Äôs men either side of half-time, to make short work of Sheffield United. 25 ‚Äì Sadio Man√© has scored 25 Premier League goals at Anfield since the start of last season ‚Äì across the top five European leagues, the only two players with more at a specific venue are Lionel Messi (29 at the Camp Nou) and Kylian Mbapp√© (27 at the Parc des Princes).

The player to have picked up an injury was Naby Keita.

Liverpool are now set for a nervy wait for a diagnosis on Keita‚Äôs injury, ahead of a pair of key fixtures versus Everton and Tottenham over the coming week. As things stand, the Merseysiders are already without the services of sidelined midfield duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Fabinho. *Update* Jurgen Klopp has confirmed during a post-match interview that Keita suffered a groin injury during his side‚Äôs warmup this evening, and has as a result been ruled out of Liverpool‚Äôs FA Cup meeting with Everton this weekend. Klopp on Keita: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his groin and he won‚Äôt be involved v Everton. It was the last shot warming up when he felt something.
