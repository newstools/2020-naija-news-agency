The first President of Nigeria, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe Zik, on November 22, 1937 established The West African Pilot with the major aim to fight for independence of Nigeria as well as liberate other African countries from the British colonial rule. Azikiwe personally edited the West African Pilot from 1937 to 1947. The quality of this publication won the heart of both the colonialists and indigenes yearning for self-resurgence. This newspaper thus championed national awareness and nationalistic ideas in the populace with its motto, “Show the light and the people will find the way”. The West African Pilot went out of business in 1967 following the outbreak of the Nigerian Civil War (1967–70). Since then, major attempts to resuscitate this publication were unsuccessful.
