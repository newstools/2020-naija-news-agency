Cardi B has excited Nigerians as she reveals she would be filing for her Nigerian citizenship after she considers American president, Donald Trump, a man who is putting the lives of many Americans in danger as a result of his policies. She took to her Twitter page just few minutes ago to make this revelation as well as also indicate she would be picking a tribe she wants to belong to. She wrote; “Naaaaa these memes are fuckin ?? ? but shit ain’t no joke ! Specially being from New York .Its sad this man is putting Americans live in danger.Dumbest move Trump did till date …I’m filing for my Nigerian citizenship.” She further added; “Picking my tribe.” We all would recall when time Cardi came to Nigeria, she enjoyed her stay which led to positive comments about the country from her after she got back to America. In fact while she was here, she was given a name; Chioma, which she coined to Chioma B. Does this mean she automatically has a tribe? Does she mean she automatically would be Igbo? We wait!
