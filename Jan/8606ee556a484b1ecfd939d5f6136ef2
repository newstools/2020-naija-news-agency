The reliable Fabrizio Romano has this evening confirmed that Ashley Youngâ€™s move from Manchester United to Inter Milan appears to be imminent. Links between veteran defender Young and Serie A giants Inter had begun to crop up since the opening of the January window. The former English international has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford this season. Sitting behind the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Luke Shaw, and even the emerging Brandon Williams in Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s squad, Young has managed starts in just 10 of Manchester Unitedâ€™s 22 Premier League outings to this point in the campaign.

However, it had appeared as though Inter had brought an end to their interest when widespread reports emerged, confirming that the Nerazzurri were in talks to swap the out-of-favour Matteo Politano for versatile Roma man Leonardo Spinazzola. As outlined above, though, this separate deal (which now appears imminent) has not put the Nerazzurri off their swoop for Young. In fact, it now appears certain that Conteâ€™s Serie A title contenders are set to make the Englishmanâ€™s signing official over the coming days. As per the reliable Fabrizio Romano, a â€˜total agreementâ€™ has been found between Inter and Manchester United. The former are set to fork over just â‚¬1.5 million for Young, with medical tests booked for the coming days. Ashley Young to Inter, here we go! Total agreement with Man United for â‚¬1,5M.
