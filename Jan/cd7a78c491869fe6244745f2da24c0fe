Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp this evening opened up on a number of interesting topics, during his post-Everton press conference. The Reds got their FA Cup campaign underway a short time ago, with a Merseyside derby meeting with Carlo Ancelottiâ€™s Everton. The clash actually marked the 2nd time in 3 seasons that Liverpool had been pitted against the Blues at this stage of the competition. And, as was the case two years ago, when all was said and done at Anfield, it was the hosts who emerged victorious. A wonder-strike from teenager Curtis Jones 20 minutes from time eventually proved the difference between the sides, as Liverpoolâ€™s remarkable 2019/20 campaign rolled on. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js The European championsâ€™ victory this evening came despite Jurgen Klopp having made it clear that his focus remains firmly on securing the Premier League title, with the German having fielded a fully 2nd-choice XI versus Everton: ðŸ”´ TEAM NEWS ðŸ”´ Our #EmiratesFACup line-up to face @Everton ðŸ‘‡ #MerseysideDerby #FACup https://t.co/ivIwj3UQbm â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) January 5, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As showcased above, one of the few senior stars to have been handed a start for the Reds, though, was James Milner. As such, it came as a major blow when, with less than 10 minutes on the clock, the veteran midfielder picked up an injury. In preventing what would otherwise likely have been an Everton opener, Milner appeared to pull his hamstring, forcing the Liverpool star to limp off. As such, speaking in his post-match interview this evening, Jurgen Klopp was inevitably drawn on Milnerâ€™s well-being. And it was far from positive news, with the German tactician having explained: â€˜Two players started the last game and one of them got injured, so thatâ€™s the situation we are in. Thatâ€™s why a lot of managers make a lot of changes; itâ€™s nothing to do with the cup, itâ€™s the timing.â€™ â€˜[Milner] has pain, that says itâ€™s serious. Itâ€™s [his] muscle.â€™ James Milner injury update.#EmiratesFACup https://t.co/xMlczr9o8T â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) January 5, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Klopp was then drawn on the performance of January signing Takumi Minamino versus Everton. Todayâ€™s matchup marked Japanese international Minaminoâ€™s debut in the colours of Liverpool, on the back of his winter arrival from RB Salzburg. And Klopp couldnâ€™t speak highly enough about the display of the latest addition to his squad, labelling Minamino â€˜outstandingâ€™: â€˜Super, outstanding. Exactly the player we wanted, exactly the player we wished for.â€™ â€˜Your first game in a team you donâ€™t know, if itâ€™s a settled team itâ€™s already difficult â€“ this team we threw more or less on the pitch with two sessions together. And then showing this kind of game understanding, football skills are exceptional, attitude is outstanding, led the chasing pack so often in different situations, which I loved.â€™ â€˜He didnâ€™t look tired, but because we donâ€™t know him that long we just wanted to save him a little bit, so took him off.â€™ JÃ¼rgen Klopp delivered a glowing appraisal of @takumina0116â€™s performance after the new signing made his Reds debut against Everton ðŸ™ŒðŸ”´ â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) January 5, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Arsenal vs Leeds United betting tips: FA Cup third round match preview & predictions Adam Lallana speaks out over Liverpool future: â€˜Iâ€™m enjoying playing for the best team in the worldâ€™ Source: Great Goals Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk has this evening taken to social media, to praise the clubâ€™s performance in their Merseyside derby victory.
