According to them, Soundcity has been owing staff for several years and have refused to pay. They added that any staff that dares query the company over the unpaid salary gets fired.

This is not an issue that started today, It has actually been going on for YEARS and now that they’ve had enough, some of them get fired as a way of silencing the rest. And guess what? It worked! This has to be the highest form of bullying I have ever seen. You owe your staff for MONTHS without any form of explanation/communication but go on to organize concert(S) and an award show and expect them to fold their arms and do nothing? Come on! These are the issues. Awazi wrote Lol this is not a joke. Great platform aside Soundcity is easily the worst place I’ve ever worked in my life and this is taking unpaid internships into consideration. The OAPs here are superheroes yet there constantly treated like shit. Burn the whole system to the fucking ground! In the last 8 months, so many people have asked me why I left soundcity and “threw away such a great opportunity” LOL y’all don’t know the half of it. At the time I left I knew I was much better unemployed than working under the horrible conditions I was subjected to at soundcity.Won’t even get deep into the details of things but imagine being for up to 5 months at a time then having to sit through some sort of interrogation with “HR” because you sent an insanely polite email asking for info on why you haven’t been paid. This happened to @ilowitdfloEven going to pee on this place is a problem! I had to leave the entire building in the middle of my show sometimes to find a decent bathroom to pee in. Then sexual harassment ooo boy the sexual harassment in this place is on steroids! My God Then there’s the fact that nothing works in this place! I’m talking microphone issues, headphones, air conditioning
Oh don’t get me started on the constant bullying and systemic attempts to intimidate anyone that has any kind of opinion or expectation for things to be done right See the tweets below: So ALL the OAPs that work at CMA (@Soundcity985FM and @Urban96FM ) went on a silent strike due to MNTHS of unpaid salaries but instead of settling things amicably, THREE of them were singled out and fired as a lesson to the others for daring to demand what is due to them.
