Well, it appears we might be getting that sooner than we thought. The singer took to her Instagram page to hare a picture of herself working in the studio putting some touches to the EP. According to her, the body of work is 64% done but she doesn’t know what name to give it. Just like Davido, Cuppy resorted to asking her fans to help come up with a perfect name. She wrote, “My debut EP is 64% done!  …BUT what should I name it?” What do you think she should name it? See her post below: ?My debut EP is 64% done! ???? …BUT what should I name it?
