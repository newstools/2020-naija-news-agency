Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti has this afternoon provided a fitness update on his squad, ahead of their meeting with Newcastle. The Toffees are set to welcome Steve Bruce‚Äôs men to Goodison Park tomorrow night, for a Premier League clash. Hosts Everton will head into proceedings amid an altogether mixed spell of form of late. After getting off to a positive start to life under new boss Carlo Ancelotti, the Merseyside outfit have since managed just a solitary win from their last 4 across all competitions. Their most recent outing, this past weekend, saw Everton recover from a goal down to secure a 1-1 draw at West Ham. After Issa Diop handed the Hammers the lead 5 minutes before the interval, Ancelotti‚Äôs outfit quickly struck back through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, to secure a share of the spoils. In the Toffees‚Äô defence, their stalemate with struggling West Ham came with a number of the club‚Äôs key men confined to the sidelines. All of Michael Keane, Alex Iwobi, Gylfi Sigurdsson and, crucially, top-scorer Richarlison missed out at the London Stadium, severely restricting the options at the disposal of Carlo Ancelotti. As such, speaking ahead of his side‚Äôs meeting with Newcastle tomorrow night, the Everton boss this afternoon provided updates on the aforementioned quartet. In a blow for the Blues, though, both Richarlison and Sigurdsson have been ruled out. A late call, meanwhile, will need to be made on stopper Keane: ü§ï | ‚ÄúRicharlison trained today but he still has pain so is not available for tomorrow. He‚Äôs doing well but we don‚Äôt want to take a risk.‚Äù Sigurdsson also ruled out.
