The striker has been one of Everton‚Äôs best players this season, scoring eight goals and assisting three. Though, Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Richarlison will miss the trip to London due to a knee injury. ‚ÄúHe had a little problem yesterday in training,‚Äù Ancelotti revealed, as quoted by the Liverpool Echo. ‚ÄúHe will not be available for the game, we hope he will be available on Tuesday.‚Äù Ancelotti also revealed Gylfi Sigurdsson will miss the game. The good news for Everton is that Yerry Mina is fit to feature against West Ham and Jean-Philippe Gbamin is back in full training. Mina has been a star player for Everton this season, and would have been a big miss. Gbamin returning to training is also a big boost for the Toffees. The summer signing impressed in his first two appearances, before suffering a long-term injury. With lacklustre midfield options, Gbamin could bring a splash of quality in the centre, which is exactly what Everton need.
