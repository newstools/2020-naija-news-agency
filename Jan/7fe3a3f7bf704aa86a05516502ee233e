Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has this evening moved to quell the rampant speculation surrounding his future at the Emirates. Gabonese hitman Aubameyang made the move to north London from Borussia Dortmund in January of 2018. And to say that the 30-year-old has since gone on to prove himself a hit would be putting it lightly. All told, across 90 appearances in the red of Arsenal, Aubameyang has found the net a hugely-impressive 56 times, marking a ratio of just under 2 goals every 3 games. In fact, his 50th strike for the Gunners, which came back in November versus Wolves, saw ‘Auba’ etch his name into the history books of the capital giants: 🇬🇦 @Aubameyang7 for @Arsenal: 🏟 78 Games

After former boss Unai Emery announced that Granit Xhaka had been stripped of the club’s captaincy, the Spanish tactician opted to name Aubameyang as his side’s new leader.

A report from Matt Law of the Telegraph this day last week suggested that the African is eyeing a summer departure from the Emirates, as he seeks out Champions League football for next season.

The Gunners hitman appeared to suggest that he has no plans to move on any time soon, in explaining: ‘I would also like to react to some of the rumours that are going around about me in the media. People like making up stories and they should focus on what’s happening on the pitch. They talk too much and it does my head in!’ ‘I am the Arsenal captain. I love this club. I am committed to it and desperate to bring it back to the top, where it belongs.’ Manchester United vs Manchester City betting tips: Carabao Cup semi-final first leg match preview & predictions The latest on Eddie Nketiah’s future following Arsenal return Source: Great Goals
