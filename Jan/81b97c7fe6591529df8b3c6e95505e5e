Arsenal played host to Sheffield United on Saturday afternoon. The Gunners began the day sat 10th in the Premier League, 11 points away from a Champions League place. Arsenalâ€™s form heading into the clash was also pretty average with the North London outfit picking up just one victory in five league games. And while Arsenal have improved slightly under Mikel Arteta, they were faced with a tough test on Saturday. Sheffield United have been superb this season with the Blades kicking off at the Emirates sat 6th in the English top-flight. Chris Wilderâ€™s side also boast one of the best defensive records in the PL this term.

The most noticeable absence was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who is serving a three-match suspension after being shown a straight red vs Crystal Palace last weekend. As well as Aubameyang, there was another big omission in the Gunnersâ€™ backline. Sokratis has partnered David Luiz in Arsenalâ€™s defence throughout much of this campaign. But the former Borussia Dortmund man was left out of the 18 with Shkodran Mustafi being handed a rare league start vs Sheffield United. Todayâ€™s team newsâ€¦ ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Martinelli in starting XI
