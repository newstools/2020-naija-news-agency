I don‚Äôt want to mention names but more than 85% of popular male actors in our movie industry sleep with rich sugar mummies in Lagos and Abuja to maintain their affluent lifestyles. There is a particular actor in this industry that has even slept with his girlfriend‚Äôs¬† mum ‚Äì all because of money‚Äù he posted on his Instagram page.
