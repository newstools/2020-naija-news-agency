Luke Shaw’s late scratch from Manchester United’s squad to face Norwich City has this afternoon been explained. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men welcomed bottom of the table Norwich to Old Trafford a short time ago, for a Premier League clash. The Red Devils headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back performance, on the back of a 3-match winless streak across all competitions. The latest of these came on Tuesday night, when United were deservedly downed by 3 goals to 1 by Man City in the League Cup semi-final first-leg between the clubs. When all was said and done in Manchester this afternoon, however, the hosts got back on track, and in style. A dominant showing on the part of Solskjaer’s outfit eventually saw them romp to a 4-0 victory. Marcus Rashford proved the star of the show, bagging a brace in less than an hour on the pitch, with Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood having also been on target. 🔴 Marcus Rashford has been involved in 17 PL goals (13 goals, 4 assists) this season, a new career best, surpassing his total of 16 last season 👏 pic.twitter.com/n1pD71ZzoO — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) January 11, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js As outlined above, though, one of Manchester United’s stars to have been absent not only from the club’s starting XI, but their matchday squad altogether this afternoon, was Luke Shaw. Left-back Shaw was originally named as part of the Red Devils’ bench to take on Norwich. However, moments before kick-off, it was announced that the English international had been replaced by youngster Tahith Chong: 🚨 A late change to the #MUFC bench: ➡️ @TahithC
