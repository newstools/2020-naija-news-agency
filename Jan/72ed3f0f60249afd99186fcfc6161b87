Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has this afternoon spoken out over Ashley Youngâ€™s imminent transfer to Serie A giants Inter Milan. Veteran defender Young has been on the books of United since 2011, when he made the move to Manchester from Premier League rivals Aston Villa. However, having continued to play a key role for the Red Devils over the last couple of seasons, Young has since fallen down the defensive pecking order at Old Trafford this season. Sitting behind the likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Luke Shaw, and even the emerging Brandon Williams in Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s squad, Young has managed starts in just 10 of Manchester Unitedâ€™s 22 Premier League outings to this point in the campaign.

Antonio Conteâ€™s Inter Milan, meanwhile, have been the outfit most hotly-tipped to swoop for Young. And, following weeks of mounting speculation, it was finally confirmed by multiple reliable sources last night that a deal between the Nerazzurri and United had been struck, with Young set to put pen-to-paper on a deal at the San Siro imminently.

And the United boss went on to cite the level of emerging talent in his squad, as well as Interâ€™s offer of a two-year contract, as key to the Red Devilsâ€™ decision to sanction Youngâ€™s departure: â€˜Well, to be fair, I think it was for Ashley, you know.â€™ â€˜He is 35 in the summer and, if he gets a two-year contract somewhere, I think itâ€™s up to him to take that. We werenâ€™t ready to offer that.â€™ â€˜Heâ€™s been a good servant for the club. Heâ€™s been captain and heâ€™s won trophies, leagues, cups, but weâ€™ve got players coming through.â€™ â€˜So it was time now, then. When Ashleyâ€™s head and mindset was on â€˜yeah, I want to try thisâ€™, why not do it now?â€™ Ole has confirmed that #MUFC defender Ashley Young is on the brink of signing for Inter Milan. â€” Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 17, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Newcastle vs Chelsea betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Watford vs Tottenham betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions West Ham vs Everton betting tips: Premier League preview & predictions Manchester City vs Crystal Palace betting tips: Premier League match preview & predictions Source: Great Goals The reliable Fabrizio Romano has this evening confirmed that Ashley Youngâ€™s move from Manchester United to Inter Milan appears to be imminent.
