DMW artiste Peruzzi Peruzzi has been caught again in another controversy. In the late hours of Wednesday (January 29th), the DMW artiste was accused of quite some heavy things. Peruzzi who was recently embroiled in a bitter war of words with Mr. Patrick Anyaene, his former boss at Goldenboy Entertainment, has another fresh problem to deal with. A yet unidentified woman (Daffy Blanco), in a series of posts on Instagram, said that Peruzzi, who was employed to write songs for her, tried to sleep with her. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267531" src="https://i1.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200129_2234122.jpg?resize=1152%2C1295&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1152" height="1295" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img data-attachment-id="267532" data-permalink="https://naijanewsagency.com/watch-asa-perform-murder-in-the-usa-live-in-studios-ferber/attachment/267532/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6166C451-2521-4A6D-B439-88201C3E73E4.jpeg?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1280,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6166C451-2521-4A6D-B439-88201C3E73E4.jpeg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6166C451-2521-4A6D-B439-88201C3E73E4.jpeg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267532" src="https://i0.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200129_2234204.jpg?resize=1152%2C1289&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1152" height="1289" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-267533" src="https://i0.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_20200129_2234162.jpg?resize=1152%2C1248&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1152" height="1248" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The account of the accuser has since been deactivated. But one wonders, like many other events spiraling around the DMW family, if this isnâ€™t a publicity stunt. Thereâ€™s a good chance it is, and also a chance itâ€™s not. Journalism is dead, and weâ€™ll never know for sure. Peruzzi, as usual, has taken to Twitter to respond these fresh allegations. Got arrested the other time at the airport Cos you lied that I threatened you with a gun. E no work after all investigations. Why donâ€™t you just leave it for the court? <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f602.png?ssl=1" alt="ðŸ˜‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" /> â€” PERUZZI (@Peruzzi_VIBES) January 29, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Make we dey watch.

It threatens to undermine his somewhat revolutionary inclusion of songwriters on A Good Time. The Peruzzi Saga, one which has been news for sometime now is, of course, about contractual agreements. Nigerian artistes seldom stay for a long period at their firstâ€¦ January 24, 2020 In "Music/Video" I am certainly not a fan of any music award shows out of Nigeria presently, as most of them have been reduced to badly scripted popularity contests at best and a patronage scheme at their worst. I mean, I have seen all sorts of absurdity happen at these awards ceremoniesâ€¦ January 10, 2019 In "News"
