‚ÄúEven though Ihedioha has won in a tribunal and at the Appeal Court, that doesn‚Äôt mean that he will triumph in Supreme Court enough of all this brouhaha‚Ä¶‚Äù Those were the exact words of the controversial Catholic priest, Fr Mbaka in his New Year prophecy. The Supreme Court on Tuesday evening sacked Governor Emeke Ihedioha and announced the All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate, Hope Uzodinma as the winner of the governorship election in Imo State March 2019. The social media, in droves, especially on Twitter, has popularised the event and in split seconds, Father Mbaka, Hope Uzodinma, Emeka Ihedioha and #ImoState were all trending. It was a blend of praise for his prophetic precision at a time many clerics had failed. In fact, sports bet fanatics sarcastically ask the cleric to give them betting odds.
