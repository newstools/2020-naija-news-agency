Banky W had gone on Twitter on the 21st of April to ask for the assistance of the Nigerian Army as controlling a crowd of over a thousand Nigerians is no small feat. This request is presently receiving mixed reactions as Twitter users speak against using the Nigerian army due to their history of physically harassing any Nigerian who acts contrary to their commands. According to these Twitter users, this request is a bad idea as people might be maltreated but other Twitter users who seem to understand the reason for the request opined that contrary to the negative reaction, this path will actually be fruitful as the Nigerian Army is one of the most feared authorities in Nigeria, hence the chances of keeping people in order is higher. <img class="size-full wp-image-272391 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/banky.jpg?resize=499%2C349&#038;ssl=1" alt="banky" width="499" height="349" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Banky W wants soldiers to come and enforce social distancing before they serve food, is it a relief camp in Vietnam? â€” Folayan (@Onflood_) April 21, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Banky W is local tout the military that contributed 80% on Nigerian failures what good can come out from them ? For him to say so means that he donâ€™t know as he claimed to know â€” Nwokwa Nnamdi (@Igbo_Speaker) April 21, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Banky W is using his platform, his money& his time to help the vulnerable this period You complain the Govt isn't doing enough and here is someone helping. He tweeted he needs the Army to help with crowd control and you attack him Sometimes we actually deserve our leaders â€” Cinderella Man (@Osi_Suave) April 21, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js I love Banky W, but truth be told; the food items he's sharing are campaign strategy to be used in 2023. You all thought he's doing it to help people out of love, it's a political game. This is how most politicians do before getting to office, showing fake love until they enter. â€” Lazy Youth Ambassador <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1f3-1f1ec.png?ssl=1" alt="ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" /> (@DarreySmuse) April 21, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Naija.
