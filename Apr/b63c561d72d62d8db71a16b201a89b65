But as at today (Friday), we have been able to trace and identify the patient and will be going after the patient immediately.” Though calls and SMS to the Delta State Commissioners for information, Charles Aniagwu and his health counterpart, Dr. Mordi Ononye were unreplied, the zonal medical director of the hospital, Dr. Bernard Ojekudo denied the incident when contacted.
