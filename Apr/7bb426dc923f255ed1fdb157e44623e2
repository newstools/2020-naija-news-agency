I never been a money man
But they all call me the money man
I heard them say I gat a hologram
Gimme my motherfucker money man
Cos ain’t never play when it comes to my dough
9 millimeter I win the beat o
My enemy is getting too close
And I give that space, put dem under my nose
I keep my money in a knapsack
Too much to carry in a backpack
Don’t even think to come rob me
Two shots take that [Pre-chorus]
I dey hustle for my daily bread, Oluwa cover me o
I know this life it’s a struggle but my hustle sure for me o
Do your own make I do my own I no like long tory o
If the money no be mine Ko si oun to kan mi o [Chorus]
