COVID19 Update(Nigeria): 
confirmed 0, deaths 0, recovered 0  Superstar Tiwa Savage delivered a dope set on an IG Live performance, interpolating popular gospel songs. Tiwa Savage earlier today, delivered a dope performance on her IG Live. With live production from Mystro, the pop goddess sang her heart out on some of the biggest gospel songs. As everyone is instructed to stay at home, entertainers are using their platforms to entertain. But Tiwa, keying into her faith as a Christian, recognizes the somewhat spiritual thirst for praises and the uplifting vibes (gotten from gospel), especially now that no one attends church. Rather than preview new music or perform her hits, she sought the truest part of one: the soul. And we’re thankful for this beautiful performance. By now, you should know: in this house, we stan Tiwa Savage. But after watching this, we stan even harder.
