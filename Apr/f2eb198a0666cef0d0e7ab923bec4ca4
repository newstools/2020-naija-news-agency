Tottenham are said to be ‘unimpressed’ after Jose Mourinho took three players out for a public training session that flouted social distancing rules.

Government guidelines stipulate that people should only exercise with other members of their household, and we are sure that Mourinho does not live with those three players. According to the Evening Standard, senior officials from the club spoke to Mourinho and reminded him of his responsibility. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f3c3.png?ssl=1" alt="🏃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em;max-height: 1em" data-recalc-dims="1" />
