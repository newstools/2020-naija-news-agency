COVID19 Update(Nigeria): 
confirmed 373, deaths 11, recovered 99 Loris Karius says he is in “good contact” with Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool but claims it is “too early” to predict what will happen in the summer. The German goalkeeper is in the middle of his second year on loan at Turkish giants Besiktas and is not due to return to Anfield until the end of the season. Karius lost his place as No. 1 goalkeeper at Liverpool after the arrival of Brazil keeper Alisson and his failure to regain confidence after his two howlers in the 2018 Champions League final.

The fact is that I have a contract in Liverpool until 2022,” Karius told SportBild (via Sport Witness) when asked about his future at Besiktas. “And at the moment I’m just concentrating on the season at Besiktas. It is far too early to say anything about summer. Especially now that nobody knows how to proceed exactly because to the Coronavirus.” On speculation he could return to the Bundesliga, Karius added: “I had great success in the Bundesliga and always enjoyed it. But it [a move] has to make sense. “The most important thing for me is that the club absolutely wants me, has a clear vision and that both sides have the absolute will to achieve something. Above all, I have to have a good feeling about those responsible.” On contact with Liverpool boss Klopp, Karius continued: “I primarily text to goalkeeper coach John Achterberg, almost every week. He is my first point of contact. But now and then I also text to Jurgen Klopp, I’m in good contact with everyone. I was never out of it.” The F365 Show is on hiatus until the football returns. Subscribe now ready for its glorious comeback.
