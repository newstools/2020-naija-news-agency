Latasha explained that the incident happened moments before she was about to take a shower. Photos from the aftermath of the collapse show her broken bathtub and a gaping hole in her ceiling. She thanked God for saving her life as she might have been seriously harmed if the ceiling had fallen when she was already taking a shower. <img class="size-full wp-image-1401771 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/La.jpg?resize=640%2C1136&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="1136" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1401768 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/La-2.jpg?resize=828%2C1472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="828" height="1472" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1401770 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/La-3.jpg?resize=828%2C1472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="828" height="1472" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Photo Credit: @latashalagos The post Latasha Ngwube has a Lot to be Thankful for after Escaping a Major Disaster appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
