I believe in the power of Global Africanism and ‘thought provoking’, ‘out-of-the-box’ Style as a tool of in-depth expression . I reflect this ideology, in my technique to build unique Fashion Editorials and Personal Style. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170126" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2047%2C2560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="2047" height="2560" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170127" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2047%2C2560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="2047" height="2560" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170128" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Image-scaled.jpg?resize=2047%2C2560&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="2047" height="2560" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Photographer: @felixcrown
