confirmed 305, deaths 7, recovered 58 Queen Nwokoye, the Lagos-based Nollywood actress, is wondering why the country has to import Chinese doctors, especially with the figures of discharged Coronavirus patients on the increase, according to government information. She feels there is something the government is not telling Nigerians. She tweeted this on her official Twitter page,”I have a question.

With the number of recovered patients we have recorded, other countries should be inviting our doctors.” Nwokoye said.
