A photo from Brymo’s video for ‘Strippers + White Lines’ Brymo released an album today, Yellow, and it’s been the rave just about everywhere. While yesterday was subject to much controversy and interaction on social media, today, a new month, saw the focus shift to Brymo’s Yellow, his seventh solo album, and his first since 2018’s Oso.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271058" src="https://i2.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-161629.png?resize=720%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brymo's Yellow Album Is The Rave On Social Media! (See Reactions) " width="720" height="267" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The artiste, who’d tagged himself “the greatest Nigerian artist since Fela,” no doubt has a cult following, and his projects are released to a high level of excitement within that community. Before the release of the album proper, he premiered the visuals of ‘Strippers + White Lines,” the lead single off the album. And since morning, after listening, many have shared thoughts, and have subsequently got the words ‘Brymo’ and ‘Yellow Album’ trending.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271060" src="https://i2.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-162610.png?resize=720%2C389&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="389" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271061" src="https://i2.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-161718.png?resize=720%2C484&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="484" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271063" src="https://i0.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-161035.png?resize=712%2C594&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="712" height="594" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img data-attachment-id="271064" data-permalink="https://naijanewsagency.com/james-hope-college-announces-acquisition-of-the-american-international-school-lagos-facility/attachment/271064/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bc6f6e60-e0b0-4c99-b56c-8c85c34c9ead-1.jpg?fit=1080%2C720&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1080,720" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bc6f6e60-e0b0-4c99-b56c-8c85c34c9ead-1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bc6f6e60-e0b0-4c99-b56c-8c85c34c9ead-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271064" src="https://i1.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-161010.png?resize=720%2C503&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="503" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271065" src="https://i2.wp.com/notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_20200401-161125.png?resize=720%2C377&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="377" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The post Brymo’s Yellow Album Is The Rave On Social Media!
