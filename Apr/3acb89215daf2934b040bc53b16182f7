Code name
Girl I want spoil you, don’t mind if you get NAFDAC or not
Mainland Muslim babe she no no Christian Dior
She say my name be like 47 emoji hearts
We all know where she’s from
*Ghetto ghetto*
57 bottles for 57 the shorty fear
Take her to buzz bar, bring the buzz light here
No forks given Silver forks nice idea
She just met the man of the year
Ayaya This night we (fire yaya)
Six rounds and she no dey (tire yaya)
You be my picker and I’ll be your maga
And for your Aza I go (wire yaya)
This night we (fire)
Six rounds and she no dey (tire)
You be my picker and I’ll be your maga
And for your house I go (wire) [Peruzzi]
Shorty want a guy like me
Never date a superstar
She wants a man like me
She’s from the ghetto na
She give me cop on me
Turn me to patapa
But ko bo si
She’s from the ghetto no O o ooh ghetto ghetto (ghetto ghetto)
E e e eh ghetto ghetto (ghetto ghetto)
O o ooh ghetto ghetto (ghetto ghetto)
E e eeh ghetto ghetto [Verse 2 – Dremo]
First time wey she see airport na the day we dey travel o
She no dey used to rose flowers so I came with a bottle
Never been on a runway but she look like a model
Maimi let me upgrade you to another level
Shy girl normally she wouldn’t speak (speak)
I start rolling but she don’t know he’s on fleek
Going crazy as I drive her crazy in a fast car, car
Come let me love you how you are
Ayaya This night we (fire ya)
Six rounds and she no dey (tire ya)
You be my picker and I’ll be your maga
And for your house I go (wire ya)
This night we (fire)
Six rounds and she no dey (tire)
You be my picker and I’ll be your maga
And for your Aza I go (Wire) [Peruzzi]
Shorty want a guy like me
Never date a superstar (Never doubt)

She give me cop on me
Turn me to patapa
But ko bo si (At all)
She’s from the ghetto no O o ooh ghetto ghetto (ghetto ghetto)
E e e eh ghetto ghetto (ghetto ghetto)
