The singer stated that he was tired of staying there and begged the government to open the borders. Well, it appears the singer might have to remain there for another two weeks as President Buhari extended the lockdown again. This made singer, Adekunle Gold and his wife, Simi to advise him to do something memorable during his stay in the country. The “Jore” singer took to his Twitter page to advise the “Rora” singer to use the opportunity to settle down and start a family in the country.  He wrote: “@ReekadoBanks Boya ko kuku settle down si Gabon? Find wife and start a family there. Abi ki lo feel? ????” Simi responded to the tweet saying Adekunle stole her joke and later went on to state that he was legit stuck in the country.
