Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu made this known on Monday while giving an update on the COVID-19 at the State House in Marina. Sanwo-Olu said that one million locally-made face masks had been contracted to tailors and will be distributed during the week. He urged residents not to discriminate against those who have been treated and discharged as they are free to relate with their families and the community. The governor, who said the state has recorded 14 deaths, maintained that there is no need for residents to panic. Lagos is now seeing a slow spread of community transmission of COVID19 and as such we are considering mandatory use of face masks in our plan to contain #COVID19. The rise in new cases is as a success of our house-to-house contact tracing and ramping up of tests across 20 LGAs. pic.twitter.com/qzjwvGz7pB — Babajide Sanwo-Olu (@jidesanwoolu) April 20, 2020 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Everyone needs to work together to avoid the irresponsibility of flouting the lockdown, hiding symptoms and travel history and managing #COVID19 patients at healthcare facilities without informing the @LSMOH and @NCDCgov.
