According to BBC, the demand for crude oil has reduced drastically across the world due to coronavirus lockdown which resulted in oil firms renting tankers to store the surplus supply. <img class="size-full wp-image-1403792 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Capture-4.jpg?resize=940%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="940" height="630" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Although the Brent crude price remains unchanged, Nigerians are reacting with hilarious memes to the shocking drop.
