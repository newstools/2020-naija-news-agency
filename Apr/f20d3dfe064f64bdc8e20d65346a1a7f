In late December 2019, news of a rapidly-spreading pneumonia-like virus in China started spreading across the world. The novel coronavirus, now called COVID- 19, which causes respiratory illness was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation on March 11. It has spread to at least 170 countries, infecting over 600,000 people and killing more than 30,000 people. Nigeria recorded its first case in February of 2020, and life as we know it has changed drastically. As the numbers of infected people keeps rising, individuals and businesses alike are suffering greatly and are having to improvise. Restaurants and food businesses around the country are not left out of the economic effects of COVID-19. Because public safety is the number one priority for all, many restaurants and eateries have taken the decision to close indefinitely, while others have chosen to only operate delivery services. <img class=" wp-image-403159 aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Untitled-design-19-1.png?resize=620%2C354" alt="" width="620" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /> While the restaurant business adapts to the changes, it is clear that COVID-19 is affecting the industry greatly; innovation will play a huge part in how businesses are able to lessen the economic impact. Restaurants typically make their money on a daily basis from walk-in customers and with the social distancing regulations, this has drastically reduced or stopped altogether. Before the coronavirus pandemic, you could stop by any restaurant or eatery at lunchtime on a normal day and get a sense of its success. The past few days paints a much dimmer picture as most restaurants are closed until further notice. Due to social distancing rules as a way to curb the virus, delivery options have become imperative for all restaurants who choose to stay open during this time. While most restaurants have decided to close due to the high risk to both their staff and customers, many have decided to only operate on a delivery or pick up basis. Food delivery requires innovative logistical interventions that may include buying new delivery bikes or using existing delivery companies. Restaurants are listing their meals on Jumia Food and others, while others are creating their owns apps to aid with delivery. Popular restaurant Nuli Lounge founder Ada Osakwe said “The ongoing health pandemic has caused us to close our restaurants to all visiting customers. We are still delivering your favourite Nuli Products across the mainland and island. Please order on our Nuli app.” Like many of you working from home, I have been doing a mixture of cooking myself and ordering food from restaurants I trust. Here are five of my favourite places on the island to order from in Lagos during the coronavirus shutdown: Cafeteria, Circa Non-Pareille, Z Kitchen, Toasties, Memories of Ethiopia, Mint By GC. If you google any of these places or visit their websites you can find the contact information. Tips for consumers Don’t be afraid to call up the restaurant to find out about their hygiene adaptations if they are offering delivery. While most restaurants have made public statements on their websites and social media handles. Still, feel free to call and make inquiries to make you more comfortable. Thankfully according to the World Health Organisation, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food, however, it is important to note that it can be transmitted through infected surfaces. As always, and especially at this time, sanitise your hands frequently, disinfect all surfaces including cutlery and avoid touching your face. If you have to receive food, please ensure you wear gloves and disinfect the takeaway packages. Stock up on essential foods While ordering food is great, it is unsustainable and given the unpredictability of the pandemic, if you are able to, I suggest you go to your favourite supermarket and stock up on essential foods that can last you for two weeks. While doing so remember to practice social distancing and to wear protective wear and use a sanitiser often. Don’t panic, cook at home Given the 14-day lockdown which started on March 30, in Lagos, Abuja, and Ogun, this is the perfect time to spend time cooking at home if you can. Nutrition is key during this time. So, why not make time to cook your favourite dishes?

We understand that the lack of movement is slowing down your sales, but fear not this too shall pass and you will be back on your feet in no time. Technology and digital integration will be key  to stay in touch with your customers digitally. Send emails, update your social media handles and websites. Keep your customers informed on what hygiene changes you are adapting and if you have to close, inform them of the reasons why and what alternatives you may be providing. Consider building an app or registering or Jumia foods. If you are going to stay open, ensure you have your best manpower dealing with orders. The staff you choose to work at this time is crucial. Ensure you equip them with the necessary precautionary equipment. Keep in mind that people that have to work during this time are under enormous pressure and anxiety. Take it easy on them and ensure they are healthy and check on their mental health as well. Try to organize transport to and from their houses if you can, to make it easier on them. To all our dear Culinary Delights readers, we hope you stay strong and healthy during this time. Please also ensure to take care of your mental health by trying to exercise at home and keeping in touch with your loved ones.
