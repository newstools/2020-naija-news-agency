The Malayan tiger, named Nadia, likely contracted the coronavirus from an infected—but unknown—asymptomatic zookeeper. “It’s the only thing that makes sense,” Calle says. The zoo has been closed to visitors since March 16. According to National Geographic, “several domestic animals had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including a Pomeranian and a German shepherd in Hong Kong, a domestic cat in Belgium”. Germany’s coronavirus infections topped 100,123, the third-highest number of cases in Europe after Spain and Italy, and 4,031 more than 24 hours earlier. The number of deaths rose by 140 to 1,584 on Monday. This is the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases, though government officials have warned that the worst of the crisis is yet to come. Tesla Inc. engineers showed footage of a prototype ventilator the company is trying to make with auto parts amid a shortage of the machines for coronavirus patients. According to the video on Tesla’s YouTube channel, the design includes a touch screen, computer and control system from a Model 3 electric car. According to the National Health Commission, China has reported 78 new cases of people who tested positive but show no symptoms of coronavirus, Bloomberg reports. China reported 39 additional coronavirus cases for April 5, with all but one imported. Of the confirmed cases, five of them were earlier classified as asymptomatic. China has a total of 81,708 confirmed virus cases.
