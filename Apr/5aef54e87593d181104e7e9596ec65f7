Inmate records show Thursday that Joseph “Exotic” Maldonado-Passage, is currently located at the Federal Bureau of Prisons-operated Federal Medical Center Forth Worth in Texas. Exotic’s fourth husband, 24-year-old bartender Dillon Passage, told Andy Cohen that Exotic had previously been isolated at the Grady County Jail in Chickasha, Oklahoma, over coronavirus concerns. The facility is an hour’s drive from Exotic’s former zoo, the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. The facility “put him on COVID-19 isolation,” due to the fact that “the previous jail he was at, there were cases,” Passage said on Cohen’s SiriusXM series “Andy Cohen Live.” He did not state whether Exotic had tested positive for the coronavirus. The big cat lover and star of the hit Netflix docuseries is currently serving a 22-year sentence for falsifying wildlife records, violating the Endangered Species Act by killing five tiger cubs and federal charges for a 2017 murder-for-hire scheme targeting Big Cat Rescue founder and arch-nemesis Carole Baskin. “He is no longer here at this facility,” a Grady County staffer tells The Post, recommending we reach out again tomorrow and speak to a different jail worker, but currently have “no comment.” FMC Fort Worth did not respond to a request for comment. Exotic is currently seeking a combined $94 million from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, his former business partner Jeff Lowe and several former colleagues say. The polygamist announced his lawsuit and issued a call for a pardon from Trump on March 19 on his Facebook page. “This lawsuit has been filed in the name of Justice, The Trump Administration must be made aware of the Overreach, perjury, abuse of power and the failure to uphold the Oath of their position which is truth and Justice for all,” the gun-toting Oklahoma native wrote in the post. Bookies are now taking bets on whether or not he’ll get it. The show’s popularity has also prompted a Florida sheriff to seek leads in the 23-year-old missing person cold case for Baskin’s former husband, Jack “Don” Lewis.
