And while the increased availability of online shopping is convenient, it makes it more lucrative for scammers to trick buyers into paying for goods they won’t receive or obtain their personal information for financial gain. Visa, financial institutions, and payment providers work hard to keep consumers’ payments safe – using multiple layers of security to prevent fraud, protect data, and help them get their money back if someone uses their card without permission. Yet, fraudsters are counting on consumers to be distracted and let their guard down, so they can trick them into handing over their personal or financial information. This is why we believe consumer education is key in the fight against fraud and we aim to help consumers understand how to spot fraudulent activity and how to protect their sensitive information, particularly now, when most of our payments have shifted to digital. Here are five simple steps every consumer can follow to stay safe when shopping online: Prior to making a purchase, check the merchant’s web page, privacy policies, as well as any delivery and return policies, to make sure that the items can be returned if they are received in an unsatisfactory condition or not delivered. Now, more than ever, it is critical for all of us to take part in protecting payment security and stay ahead of fraud. While we are leveraging technological advancements to prevent, detect, and decrease threats, we also need to drive further awareness and sustained consumer education. Consumers are the first line of defense, and we believe these security tips and practices can help them keep their payments and personal data safe.
