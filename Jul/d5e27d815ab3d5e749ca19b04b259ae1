Wednesday’s late Premier League kick-off pitted two of London’s rivals against each other. Chelsea would make the trip to the London Stadium, as they looked to continue their unbeaten return to action. The Blues played three ties across all competitions in June, picking up victories in each clash – including a huge win over Manchester City. Despite representing one of the in-form sides since the restart, though, Chelsea are still looking over their shoulder in the top-four race. Manchester United, like Chelsea, have been on fire since returning to action. And their 3-0 drubbing of Brighton on Tuesday meant that the Red Devils moved to within two points of Frank Lampard’s men. 6th-placed Wolves are also breathing down Chelsea’s neck, though the capital giants’ trip to West Ham came as their game in hand. Given the fact that West Ham have been pretty awful of late, meanwhile, a victory over David Moyes’ men did, on paper at least, look to be nailed on for Chelsea. Chelsea, as was to be expected during such a busy period, made several changes from their FA Cup triumph over the weekend. But there was still no place in the starting eleven for Jorginho.

Manuel Lanzini and Angelo Ogbonna came in for Mark Noble and Fabian Balbuena. The team news is in!

Chelsea would slowly begin to garner the lion’s share of possession, though, with a curling effort from Willian inside 10 minutes the Blues’ first decent chance of the evening. West Ham then had a superb chance to open the scoring just moments later. Michail Antonio smashed through Chelsea’s centre-back pairing, before slicing his effort wide of Kepa’s goal. The next big chance of the clash fell to Christian Pulisic, and, considering the form that the American has been in recently, Chelsea’s fans probably wouldn’t have preferred anyone else to be in the position to find the net. However, Pulisic’s strike curled wide of the West Ham goal. With half an hour gone, Chelsea had dominated the majority of the match. But as has so often been the case for the capital giants this season, they were somewhat lacking that killer instinct in the final third. And as has also often happened throughout the season, Chelsea then looked set to be punished for failing to make their dominance count. After a scramble in the six-yard box following a corner, Tomas Soucek would poke the ball past Kepa to give David Moyes’ men a somewhat undeserved lead. However, a rather bizarre VAR intervention saw the goal ruled out for offside. Then, in a cruel twist of fate for the relegation-battling Hammers, Chelsea went down the other end just minutes later to win a penalty, after a clumsy Issa Diop challenge on Christian Pulisic. Willian would then step up to convert the ensuing spot-kick. But Chelsea would once again fail to defend a set-piece effectively a short time later, with Cesar Azpilicueta beaten in the air by Tomas Soucek, whose effort this time stood. Kepa, along with fellow countryman Azpilicueta, was at fault for the equaliser. The shot-stopper didn’t fully commit to coming for the corner, and was made to pay. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1253716957-1024x679.jpg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JULY 01: Kepa Arrizabalaga of Chelsea looks on during the Premier League match between West Ham United and Chelsea FC at London Stadium on July 01, 2020 in London, England.

Declan Rice’s searching pass found Michail Antonio, who had a penalty appeal waved away, before getting back to his feet to slot home a cut-back. West Ham’s second of the evening would once again highlight the real lack of physicality and top quality in Chelsea’s defence. The Blues’ centre-backs spent most of the evening being bullied by Antonio, with the entire team having come out second-best from almost any set-piece battle. 29/29 – All 29 of Michail Antonio’s Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box; among current PL players, only Gabriel Jesus has a larger 100% record (37/37).

Yes, the additions of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech will no doubt be superb for the Londoners’ attacking threat. But, as has been the case throughout much of the campaign, Chelsea’s weakest spot is their defence. And if they really hope to get anywhere close to the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City, they need to change things up at the back. Lampard responded to his side blowing a 1-0 lead by bringing on Mason Mount, Olivier Giroud and Ruben Loftus-Cheek in quick succession. This trio, to their credit, did have a positive impact, with Chelsea having soon gotten back on level terms. Just inside the final 20 minutes, the Blues netted courtesy of a scintillating free-kick from Willian. Willian with a WORLDIE of a free-kick!

Antonio, who had been a thorn in Chelsea’s side all night, played Andriy Yarmolenko in with just moments of normal time remaining. The Ukrainian, who should have been tracked by Marcos Alonso, was then allowed to cut inside far too easily, before slotting past Kepa. The final whistle blew with the score at 3-2, and West Ham up to 16th. Chelsea, on the other hand, missed out on the chance to go 3rd, and are now facing serious pressure from the top-4 chasing pack.
