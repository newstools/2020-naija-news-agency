More importantly, while private settlements are usual in civil disputes, they are, however, not applicable to criminal cases, particularly where a felony has been alleged to have been committed, only the State has the authority to discontinue a criminal investigation and prosecution.“ In their response, Seyi’s legal representative, Olamide Omileye of Ojoge, Omileye, and partners told Premium Times that the only agreement reached was that “both parties are going to stand down on media trials and allow the law to take its course.” He said both parties have agreed to desist from making any post or leaking any information to the public and allow the police to carry out their investigation. “The police are still doing their investigation. Last week, Seyitan was in Abuja, D’banj was also in Abuja. They met the ACP and the woman did her part of the investigation,” View this post on Instagram ?Press Statement: In line w/ our key values— integrity & transparency; this is a detailed report of STER & partner NGO’s intervention in the case of Ms Seyitan Babatayo against Mr Oyebanjo (aka D’Banj).? ?Press Statement: Inline w/ our key values— integrity & transparency; this is a detailed report of STER & partner NGO’s intervention in the case of Ms Seyitan Babatayo against Mr Oyebanjo (aka D’Banj).? .
