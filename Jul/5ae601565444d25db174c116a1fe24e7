Premier League giants Manchester United have provided updates on the respective loans of Alexis Sanchez and Chris Smalling. Ahead of the current campaign getting underway, a number of Man United’s stars opted to swap Old Trafford for Serie A. Romelu Lukaku of course secured a big-money move to Inter Milan, following Antonio Conte’s appointment at the San Siro. Alexis Sanchez, fresh off the back of a nightmare campaign, then followed suit, joining the Nerazzurri on loan for the season. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1141474938-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Alexis Sanchez" data-recalc-dims="1" /> HUDDERSFIELD, ENGLAND – MAY 05: Alexis Sanchez of Manchester United down injured during the Premier League match between Huddersfield Town and Manchester United at John Smith’s Stadium on May 5, 2019 in Huddersfield, United Kingdom.

United’s Serie A loanees have since gone on to endure largely differing spells away from the club, with Smalling having enjoyed a major resurgence, to play a starring role at the heart of Roma’s backline. Sanchez, on the other hand, has seen his opportunities limited in Milan, following a long-term injury picked up in October. As such, it remains largely unclear what United’s long-term plans for either player entail. One thing that is certain, though, is that Sanchez and Smalling will see out the remaining weeks of the Serie A campaign with their current sides. In an official statement released earlier this evening, the Red Devils confirmed: ‘Manchester United pair Chris Smalling and Alexis Sanchez will both see out the remainder of the 2019/20 domestic campaign in Italy, after the decision was made to extend their loan contracts with Roma and Inter Milan respectively.’ ‘Smalling will stay at the Stadio Olimpico for the rest of the Serie A season, which is currently scheduled to last until the beginning of August, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.’ ‘Alexis’s deal at Inter Milan has also been extended until the end of the first week of next month.’ The latest on @Alexis_Sanchez and @ChrisSmalling #MUFC — Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 1, 2020 As things stand, though, whether Sanchez and Smalling are granted permission to see out the Europa League season with Inter and Roma remains altogether unclear. Coincidentally, on the same evening during which updates on United’s Serie A stars has been forthcoming, both Sanchez and Ashley Young (who departed Old Trafford in January) played starring roles in Inter Milan’s dominant victory over bottom of the table Brescia. Young netted the Nerazzurri’s opener from a Sanchez cross, with the latter having then added his name to the scoresheet from the penalty spot. And, incredibly, the former Red Devils then had a hand in both Inter’s 3rd and 4th, too, setting up Danilo D’Ambrosio and Roberto Gagliardini respectively to send Antonio Conte’s men on their way to a 6-0 win.
