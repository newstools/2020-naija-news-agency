Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has today opened up on a number of topics, including both Jordan Henderson’s Football of the Year award, and the controversial recent comments of Chelsea counterpart Frank Lampard. Following months of waiting, Liverpool’s delayed lifting of the Premier League trophy finally took place earlier this week. On the back of a 5-3 win over Chelsea, Jurgen Klopp’s squad took to the stands of Anfield, to celebrate their first English top-flight title in 30 years. Trophy lift. Slow motion.

While a number of the Reds’ stars of course enjoyed standout seasons, it was English international Henderson who proved the heart and soul of Liverpool throughout their title charge, driving his side forward with quality and grit in equal measure. And such excellence certainly hasn’t gone unrecognised amongst the Premier League-covering media, with the 30-year-old having added to his rapidly expanding trophy cabinet earlier today with the award for the FWA’s Footballer of the Year. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1197911139-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 01: Jordan Henderson of Liverpool celebrates winning the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Southampton FC at Anfield on February 1, 2020 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

What’s more important? Is it talent or is it attitude?’ ‘I think the easy answer is: without talent, you’re nothing; without attitude, you will stay a talent forever. You are the perfect example that a mix makes the difference.’ ‘I know the human being behind the player and you would have deserved an award for that as well. So, many congratulations, well deserved, outstanding achievement.’ ‘What a year you had, what a career so far you had, and the best news, there’s still a lot to come.’ Check out the German’s full message below: Jurgen Klopp congratulates @Jhenderson on being voted Footballer of the Year, after a historic season for @LFC: “A perfect example that a mix of talent and attitude makes the difference. Well deserved, outstanding achievement, still a lot to come. Wow!” #FOTY20 #Henderson #Klopp pic.twitter.com/0y1z89EHX9 — The FWA (@theofficialfwa) July 24, 2020 His heartfelt praise for Henderson, however, was far from Klopp’s only message to have caught the headlines today. This afternoon, the Liverpool boss was also drawn on the eye-catching recent comments of Chelsea counterpart Frank Lampard. After footage emerged of Lampard’s involvement in a heated exchange with Liverpool’s bench during his side’s defeat at Anfield during the week, the Blues boss later accused certain members of Jurgen Klopp’s coaching staff of being ‘arrogant’. As such, speaking to the media ahead of his side’s final outing of the Premier League campaign at Newcastle on Sunday, Klopp was inevitably asked for his take on Lampard’s jibe. And the German was unsurprisingly quick to defend his fellow coaches, assuring that the Reds staff are the furthest thing from arrogant as part of a lengthy response: ‘You cannot hit me and my bench with something like that because we are not arrogant.’ ‘Frank was obviously in a really competitive mood and I respect that a lot. From my point of view in this sort of situation you can say pretty much what you want. For me, after the game it is completely over.’ ‘I said a lot in the past because it is pure emotion. He came here to win the game or get a point, to make Champions League qualification, and I respect that a lot. But what he has to learn is to finish it with the final whistle and he didn’t do that.’ ‘Speaking afterwards about it like this, that’s not okay, Frank has to learn this and he has a lot of time to learn as he is a young coach but that is what he has to learn.’ ‘During the game, the words used were no problem at all but after final whistle? No.’ ‘We are not arrogant, we are pretty much the opposite. But in a moment like this in an argument you want to say something to hurt the other person. I have no problem with that but at the final whistle close the book. He didn’t do that and that is what I don’t like.’ ‘And by the way, the reason I speak now about it – because otherwise there would be no words from me – but because he spoke after about it, I feel the need to explain!’ Quotes via Goal Newcastle United vs Liverpool live streaming and betting tips Liverpool agree deal to send Dejan Lovren to Zenit/Reds locked in Wijnaldum contract talks Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
