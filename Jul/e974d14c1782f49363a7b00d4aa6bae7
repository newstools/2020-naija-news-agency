It has been impressive to see how OPPO Mobile has shown dynamism by having a different approach to the Nigerian market without losing the essence of the true Nigerian culture. The brand has also shown a willingness to support Nigerian talent, from photography to videography to content creation to modelling; OPPO has indeed made a strong statement that it is not just a brand that promises but also a brand that changes lives. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Oppo-Nigeria-Tacha-Deal-BBNaija-image3-600x400.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Will the Tacha partnership be a good move for OPPO in its continuous rise to the top in Nigeria?
