Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has provided an explanation for his decision not to start the in-form Christian Pulisic in his side’s meeting with Manchester United. The Blues are currently locked in action with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men at Wembley. The clash marks the 2nd of two FA Cup semi-final fixtures this weekend, with the winner set to take on Arsenal in the competition’s showpiece on August 1st. Manchester United, based on both form and head-to-head, were viewed as favourites ahead of kick-off in the English capital, with the Red Devils riding a 19-game unbeaten run, and having downed Chelsea in all 3 of their prior meetings this season. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1179076214-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (L) and Chelsea’s English head coach Frank Lampard gesture at the final whistle during the English League Cup fourth round football match between Chelsea and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in London on October 30, 2019.

The first-half at Wembley, though, has since seen Lampard’s men edge things, albeit just. A tense opening 45 minutes, during which both United and Chelsea struggled to carve out clear-cut opportunities, was finally lit up by one moment of quality on the stroke of the interval. A teasing delivery from the right courtesy of Cesar Azpilicueta was met by Olivier Giroud, who slotted home beyond the despairing David de Gea: GIROUD! #EmiratesFACup #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/ZslmfqUOJb — The Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) July 19, 2020 The disjointed nature of this evening’s clash thus far, though, should not come as too much of a surprise. This comes with both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Frank Lampard having introduced a number of changes to their respective starting lineups. The former set his side up as follows, with the likes of Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial dropping to the bench: In the red corner…#MUFC #FACup @DHLManUtd — Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 19, 2020 Chelsea, meanwhile, started with the following XI: Today’s team! #MUNCHE pic.twitter.com/2rumGxdOoQ — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 19, 2020 The main talking point surrounding the Blues’ line-up in the hour leading up to kick-off, meanwhile, came in the form of the absence of Christian Pulisic. United States international Pulisic has been in superb form of late, proving key to his side maintaining their spot in the Premier League’s top-4. Frank Lampard, though, confirmed in a pre-match interview that his side’s goalscoring wide-man has picked up a ‘small injury’ problem, forcing him to the bench versus United: ‘Christian Pulisic has got a small injury issue and there is a risk in starting (and) him trying to play the full game.’ ‘Maybe he can come off the bench but other than that I am confident that I have picked a team that can win the game.’ The in-form winger has a little injury problem.https://t.co/oTAooz84vq — Chelsea FC News (@Chelsea_FL) July 19, 2020 Willian reveals why he’s not signed a new Chelsea deal Manchester United vs Chelsea live streaming: Watch FA Cup semi-final online, preview, prediction and odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
