An insight into the apparent summer transfer plans of Manchester United has been forthcoming online over the last 24 hours. Ahead of the opening of the delayed summer transfer window, Premier League giants Man United have been tipped as a potential landing spot for a whole host of star names. On the back of the upturn in form enjoyed by the Red Devils following Bruno Fernandes’ January arrival, things are finally starting to look up at Old Trafford. United’s drubbing of Bournemouth last weekend saw them extend the club’s unbeaten streak to 16 games across all competitions, with an FA Cup and Europa League double also still potentially on the cards. A firm recruitment plan also appears to be in place moving forward, which is set to see the Manchester powerhouse focus their attentions on signing and developing young talent, to surround high-profile names like the aforementioned Fernandes, Paul Pogba and David de Gea. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1204322708-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea reacts during the English Premier League football match between Everton and Manchester United at Goodison Park in Manchester United, north west England on March 1, 2020.

The report comes courtesy of the reliable James Ducker of the Telegraph, and surrounds the potential impact of Paul Pogba extending his stay in Manchester. The Red Devils’ improvements of late have seemingly seen World Cup winner Pogba swayed towards staying put, with management now ‘increasingly optimistic’ that the 27-year-old will put pen-to-paper on a new contract with the club. This, in turn, has seen United cool their interest in Aston Villa star Jack Grealish, with the Old Trafford powerhouse no longer prioritising midfield reinforcements. Instead, Solskjaer is now ‘particularly keen’ to add a right-sided winger to his squad, with long-term target Jadon Sancho the Norwegian’s first-choice option. Along with reinforcements out wide, though, United are also said to be keen on adding fresh faces at centre-half, and centre-forward. Solskjaer hopeful Paul Pogba will sign a new contract at #MUFC, with Jack Grealish’s prospects of a move to OT fading. With Pogba likely staying & Fernandes/Matic/McTominay/Fred to pick from, Solskjaer has other priorities in transfer window over midfield https://t.co/ar8frh8EVY — James Ducker (@TelegraphDucker) July 8, 2020 Man United boost: Real Madrid ‘drop’ van de Beek interest Paul Pogba tells Man United what they must do to become a ‘top, top team’ Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
