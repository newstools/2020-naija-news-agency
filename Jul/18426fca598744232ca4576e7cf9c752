 The Senate on Wednesday urged the Federal Government to raise the age limit usually attached to job vacancies in the country. The call followed The Upper Chamber’s consideration of a motion, titled: “Urgent need to review age barrier during recruitment and employment,” sponsored by Senator Ibrahim Gobir (Sokoto East). Citing Orders 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, Gobir noted that the recruitment requirement of Federal Government’s Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other private bodies, which set age barriers, “inadvertently excludes and marginalises skilful and competent prospective applicants from participating in such exercises”. He added: “Due to the high unemployment rate in the country, many graduates spend up to 10 years seeking employment and this puts them in a disadvantaged position by no fault of theirs. “Many individuals resort to falsifying their age, all in a bid to fall within the required age limit, for them to be gainfully employed. “This development, where a person believes he is unemployable, can lead them to embracing criminal activities and further increase the growing crime rate and insecurity in the country.”  Original Article
