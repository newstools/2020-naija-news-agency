The latest word stemming from the Dutch media suggests that Real Madrid have come to the decision to drop their interest in Donny van de Beek. Van de Beek, 23, has established himself as one of Dutch football’s most highly-regarded talents over the last couple of seasons. The goalscoring midfielder is a product of Ajax’s famed youth academy, with van de Beek having gone on to play a starring role in the club’s first-team setup since first emerging onto the scene during the 2016-17 campaign. The 9-time capped international directly contributed to a hugely-impressive 36 Eredivisie goals over the course of the last two seasons combined, the 2nd of which saw Ajax dethrone champions PSV Eindhoven. While his domestic exploits have proven of the highest standard for some time now, however, what saw van de Beek begin to truly catch the eye throughout Europe were the Dutchman’s performances in the Champions League last season. The talented youngster played an integral role in the Ajax side that shocked the masses en route to the competition’s semi-finals, notching crucial goals versus the likes of Juventus and Tottenham. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140414434-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – APRIL 30: Donny van de Beek of Ajax celebrates scoring the opening goal during the UEFA Champions League Semi Final first leg match between Tottenham Hotspur and Ajax at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 30, 2019 in London, England.

The 2019/20 campaign, however, is expected to stand as the midfield creator’s last at the Johan Cruijff ArenA. While Ajax managed to hold onto van de Beek last summer despite the departures of the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt, it has long been widely-acknowledged that the 23-year-old will likely be snapped up by one of European football’s heavyweights over the coming months. Real Madrid were hotly-tipped as a potential destination for van de Beek last year, with outlets in Europe having since gone as far as to claim that an agreement was in place to finally take the Dutchman to the Bernabeu ahead of next season. Such speculation, though, was subsequently shut down by van de Beek himself, who assured that he is yet to make a decision on his future. This, in turn, has seemingly reopened the race for the Ajax man’s signature, with reports stemming from Spain having hinted at serious interest on the part of Premier League giants Manchester United. And, as outlined above, the Red Devils now appear to have a free run at van de Beek, if they choose to make their interest formal this summer. According to the reliable De Telegraaf (via Goal), Real Madrid have come to the definitive decision to drop their pursuit of the Dutchman. Los Blancos are said to have set their sights on other targets to reinforce their midfield ranks, with van de Beek now little more than a backup option. Another potential landing spot for the Ajax man, though, are Juventus, with the Bianconeri thought to be keeping a close eye on developments at the Johan Cruijff ArenA.
