Fred says that Man Utd will be going all out to win the Champions League next season despite not yet qualifying for the competition. The Red Devils need to avoid defeat on the final day of the season against fellow hopefuls Leicester City, while their other rivals for the top four Chelsea need a draw to make sure of their place. Man Utd have only qualified for the Champions League in two of the last four seasons with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side having to settle for competing in the Europa League this term. MAILBOX: Man Utd fans expected Gerrard but wound up with Lampard… And Fred can’t wait to get United back in the Champions League and competing against Europe’s elite once again. “As a club, we should be in the Champions League every year as we’re a massive club,“ Fred told the United’s official website. “So to be back in the Champions League is really important for us players, it’s also important for the club. “It’s what the players and the club deserve. It will be great to be back in the Champions League next season and we will look to win.” On Man Utd captain Harry Maguire returning to the King Power Stadium, Fred added: “It must be a great feeling for him [Maguire] because he’ll be going back to see his old team-mates. He was there for a long time, so he must have some strong friendships there and so it must be good feeling. ”But today he’s representing Manchester United and, as we’ve said, he will be doing his everything to avoid us conceding and come away with the win.” The post Fred: Man Utd will look to win the Champions League next season appeared first on Football365.
