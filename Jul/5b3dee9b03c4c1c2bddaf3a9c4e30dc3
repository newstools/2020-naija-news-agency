Borussia Dortmund starlet Jadon Sancho this afternoon briefly opened up on his current mindset, admitting that, as things stand, he is unaware of where his future lies. Despite the financial restrictions set to be brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, speculation surrounding the futures of some of European football’s biggest stars has continued to swirl ahead of the opening of the summer transfer window. The likes of Paul Pogba, Philippe Coutinho and Neymar have been hotly-tipped to be on the move over the coming months, with Manchester United and Barcelona just two of the sides hopeful of securing major reinforcements ahead of next season. Few, if any, though, have been more persistently linked with an imminent exit from their current club than Jadon Sancho. Following another scintillating campaign with Borussia Dortmund, during which the young Englishman racked up a hefty 20 goals and 20 assists, speculation has been rife that Sancho could be set for a Premier League return.

Watch the Bundesliga live on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) May 23, 2020 To this point, the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and even former club Manchester City have been tipped as potential landing spots for the explosive 20-year-old. No club, though, have been more persistently linked with Sancho than Manchester United. The Red Devils have long been reported to have established themselves as frontrunners in the race for the Dortmund star’s signature, amid claims that Sancho is ‘very open’ to the prospect of a move to Old Trafford. Recent speculation has even gone as far as to suggest that the personal terms of a contract have already been agreed between the parties. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1200824539-1024x677.jpg?resize=1024%2C677&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Dortmund’s English midfielder Jadon Sancho celebrate scoring during the German first division Bundesliga football match BVB Borussia Dortmund vs Eintracht Frankfurt, in Dortmund, western Germany on February 14, 2020.

The Englishman, though, remained altogether non-committal with his response. Sancho explained: ‘I don’t know what to say to that. It’s hard to say. That’s the future.’ ‘You never know what could happen, so we will wait and see.’ Interestingly, the Dortmund star also went on to provide an insight into some of the players who inspired him during his younger years. Sancho named both Liverpool legend John Barnes and Ronaldinho as players whom he enjoyed watching, with the former a result of his father’s influence: ‘My dad was a big fan of John Barnes. He had a couple of videos of him at home and I used to watch them a lot.’ ‘I used to look at Ronaldinho on YouTube. That was a big thing for me. He used to try things that no-one else would try and that made me like him a lot.’ He added, though, that: ‘I didn’t have a team that I supported, though. I just idolised a lot of great players.’ His Borussia Dortmund future remains uncertainhttps://t.co/6yjfbliDU8 — Liverpool FC News (@LivEchoLFC) July 18, 2020 Frank Lampard backs suggestions VAR is favouring Man United/Solskjaer claps back at Chelsea boss Timothy Fosu-Mensah to be handed ‘chance to secure long-term future’ at Man United Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
