News broke on Monday that he has been arrested by officials of the Department of State Services (DSS). According to Magu’s S.A. on Media, Tony Amokeodo, Magu was only invited before a panel of the Federal Government to answer questions regarding allegations of corruption levelled against him. The panel is currently sitting at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, Channels News reports. The DSS, in a 2016 report, accused Magu of having links to a “questionable businessman”. The statement reads: In December 2010, the Police Service Commission (PSC) found Magu guilty of action prejudicial to state security – withholding of EFCC files, sabotage, unauthorised removal of EFCC files and acts unbecoming of a police officer, and awarded him severe reprimand as punishment. Magu is currently occupying a residence rented for N40m at N20m per annum. This accommodation was not paid [for] from the commission’s finances, but by one Umar Mohammed, air commodore retired, a questionable businessman who has subsequently been arrested by the secret service. For the furnishing of the residence, Magu enlisted the Federal Capital Development Authority to award a contract to Africa Energy, a company owned by the same Mohammed, to furnish the residence at the cost of N43m. Investigations show that the acting EFCC chairman regularly embarked on official and private trips through a private jet owned by Mohammed. In one of such trips, Magu flew to Maiduguri alongside Mohammed with a bank MD who was being investigated by the EFCC over complicity in funds allegedly stolen by the immediate past petroleum minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke. Furthermore, the EFCC boss has so far maintained a high-profile lifestyle. This is exemplified by his preference for first-class air travels. On 24 June, 2016, he flew Emirate airlines first-class to Saudi Arabia to perform lesser hajj at the cost of N2.9m. This is in spite of Mr President’s directive to all public servants to fly economy class. Magu has fostered a beneficial relationship with Mohammed who by his confession approaches clients for possible exploitation, favours and associated returns. Reacting to the news, Nigerians on Twitter are tagging his arrest a plot twist, being that he’s supposed to be in charge of corruption and now he has been arrested for corruption.
