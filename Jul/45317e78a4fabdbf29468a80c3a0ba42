When I opened it, I saw a huge sum of money, a credit card, and other valuables. I immediately reported it to the police. . One of the officers was surprised and asked me why I did not take the money. I told him that there was no need for that because I was raised by responsible parents and that I am also a Christian. He told me that according to Japanese law, I was entitled to 10% of the money found inside the wallet. Again I declined. The look on his face indicated bewilderment,” he said. Nweke who is married with four kids disclosed the owner of the wallet called him to show appreciation and also got a letter from the Ibaraki/Tsukuba Police. “They expressed their gratitude towards my incredible and selfless behavior. Not every Nigerian is criminal-minded. There are a lot of Nigerians abroad working so hard to erase the bad name given to “us” by the criminal few,”  Nweke added.
