I want to extend my gratitude to Unicaf and to the panel of judges that critiqued my work and found it worthy of this great privilege. Being in the midst of a pandemic, we now understand that the world is at war against Covid-19, and is economically weakened because of lockdowns, which have brought many universities to a stand still…. Now is the time to explore new methods of education and new perspectives, to turn to online education as the solution. The idea of online education is imperative in these challenging times, and we must use it to secure the future of our higher education system and a brighter future for us all.’ Oyafemi Toluwalase Augustine won the third prize – a 75% scholarship for a Master’s degree with Unicaf University through online delivery plus a free tablet.
