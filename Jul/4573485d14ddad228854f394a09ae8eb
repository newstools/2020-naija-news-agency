Speculation in the English media over the last 24 hours has suggested that Tottenham are eyeing up Norwich’s Max Aarons as a potential replacement for Serge Aurier. 20-year-old right-back Aarons made the move to Carrow Road in 2016, from Luton Town. And, after impressing in the youth ranks of the Canaries, Aarons was subsequently fast-tracked into the club’s first-team setup last season. The gifted stopper went on to play a key role in Norwich’s return to the Premier League, racking up 2 goals and 6 assists across 41 Championship appearances in 2018/19. And his fine displays have since carried into the English top-flight, as Aarons’ reputation as a potential star in the making continues to grow. To this point in the campaign, the youngster has started in all but 2 of Norwich’s 33 league outings. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1191144233-1024x606.jpg?resize=1024%2C606&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Norwich City’s Max Aarons has a shot on goal during the Premier League match at Carrow Road, Norwich.

Reports earlier this year saw all of Arsenal, Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund hotly-tipped to swoop for the Norwich star. And, as outlined above, one of these sides appear ready to step up their pursuit. As first reported by SportsLens, and since backed elsewhere, Spurs are readying a summer swoop for the young stopper. This comes with the Lilywhites eyeing up a replacement for Serge Aurier. And Aarons, with his his room for growth and likely availability, is seemingly viewed as the ideal man for the job, with an opening Tottenham offer expected upon the opening of the summer transfer window. In other Spurs-related transfer news, the north Londoners are said to have rejected a player swap proposal from Italian giants Juventus. As per Mike McGrath of the Telegraph, the Bianconeri offered up former Arsenal star Aaron Ramsey, as part of a deal for Tanguy Ndombele. Spurs, though, made it clear that they have no intention of parting with their record signing this summer, just a year on from his arrival at the club.
