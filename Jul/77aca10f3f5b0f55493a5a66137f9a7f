This show has given us nothing less than premium entertainment and great vibes all the way from week one, while we were still reeling from COVID-19 and lockdown episodes. It truly became the new TGIF during the new normal. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_2050.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_2170.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Week after week, DJ after DJ, dancer after dancer, and all the amazing side attractions; the show climaxed with Pepsi Ambassadors Tiwa Savage, Tekno, and DJ Obi giving us show-stopping acts.
