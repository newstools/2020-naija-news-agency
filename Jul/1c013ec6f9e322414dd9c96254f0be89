 OSUN State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has praised his deputy, Mr. Benedict Alabi, on the occasion of his 55th birthday. He said he remains a deputy governor every reasonable and responsible governor will crave. Oyetola hailed Alabi’s commitment and dedication to the ideals, policies and programmes of the All Progressives Congress-led administration. A statement yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Ismail Omipidan, described Alabi as a loyal deputy governor, who typified the Omoluabi ethos, which Osun State held dear. “Mr. Alabi remains a deputy every reasonable and responsible governor will always crave. The vibrancy and capacity of the deputy governor impact on the achievements of the government, particularly in the state’s battle to contain the spread of the deadly Coronavirus. “Our deputy governor, as you celebrate your 55th birthday today, I pray to Almighty God to grant you many more years in good health, wisdom and knowledge to continue to serve our state and humanity at large. “On behalf of my family, the government and people of Osun State, I join a worthy son of Osun and a leading member of our executive council (exco) to thank God for Alabi’s life that has been filled with achievements and accomplishments. “I pray God to keep him in good health and bless him with many years of robust service to the government and people of Osun,” Oyetola said.
