Dean Smith has this evening provided an update on the fitness of star man Jack Grealish, ahead of Aston Villa’s meeting with Manchester United. The Villans are set to return to action on Thursday evening, when they welcome in-form United to Villa Park. Dean Smith’s men will head into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, though, having fallen to consecutive defeats over the course of the last week. The latest of these came last night, when a trip to Anfield eventually saw the visitors downed by 2 goals to nil. Despite having stood firm for 70 minutes, the class of champions Liverpool eventually proved telling, as Sadio Mane’s opener was added to by youngster Curtis Jones’ injury-time strike. Villa’s defeat on Merseyside leaves them sitting a point adrift of safety in the Premier League table, with just 5 games to play. Adding to the Claret and Blues’ concerns on the back of last night’s result, meanwhile, was the fitness of star man Jack Grealish. The opening 45 minutes at Anfield saw the midfield creator forced off for treatment on a pair of occasions, with Grealish having clearly been struggling with an ankle issue. This eventually saw the 24-year-old forced into a pain-killing injection, leading to concerns that Villa’s captain may be set for a spell on the sidelines. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1142935537-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Jack Grealish" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 11th May 2019, Villa Park, Birmingham, England; EFL Championship football, playoff semi final 1st leg, Aston Villa versus West Bromwich Albion; Jack Grealish of Aston Villa (Photo by Shaun Brooks/Action Plus via Getty Images) Dean Smith, though, has since moved to put an end to such fears. Speaking in a post-match press conference, the Villa boss was drawn on Grealish’s issue, with Smith having confirmed that, somewhat bizarrely, the midfielder’s pain was caused by strapping being placed too tightly around his calf. This, in turn, seemingly cut off proper circulation to Grealish’s ankle: ‘He’s fine. Jack’s strapping was too tight on his calves so we had to loosen that for half-time. He finished the game OK. I think both his calves were tight in the end, but there’s no issue.’ Smith plays down Grealish injury fears: “He’s fine,” Smith said. “Jack’s strapping was too tight on his calves so we had to loosen that for half-time. He finished the game OK. I think both his calves were tight in the end, but there’s no issue.”https://t.co/nhPrH9DDxc#AVFC — Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) July 6, 2020 Man United in line for bonus payments from Inter Milan after Romelu Lukaku’s scoring success Nemanja Matic agrees Man United contract extension & he’s confident of finishing above Chelsea Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
