Ayuu" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GJtheCaesar – Gyrate ft. Ayuu Starting off the new year with a bang, rising artist GJtheCaesar has just dropped ‘Gyrate,’ his first single of 2020. The funky track features budding star Ayüü, and is a smooth feel-good track perfectly suited to soundtrack your springs and summers. Produced by Nosa Apollo, the architect of songs like Lady Donli’s ‘Ice Cream’ and ‘Games’, ‘Gyrate’ is a sultry blend of funk, house, and hip-hop created with the intent of getting hips to rotate and feet to slide. GJ flashes off both his sublime vocals and rapping ability, proving his ability as a true double threat. Fresh off the release of his new project ‘Ayüüniverse’ where GJ is featured on, Ayüü provides a burner of a verse that shows why he’s poised to make a leap this year. The chemistry of these two artists is evident and their energy is infectious, making ‘Gyrate’ a song that is perfect for dance floors, barbecues, house parties, and much more. RELATED: King Bernard – DOH Gyrate represents an evolution in GJ’s sound, a product of a hiatus in which he took time to experiment and learn more about different sounds, as well as himself. Although born in London, the Nigerian artist is deeply in touch with both cultures and draws inspiration from the sounds and experiences in both locales, helping to mould the universal feel of his sound. With a new project on the way, Gyrate is a taste of what’s to come, hip-hop and soul blending effortlessly with funk. A different sound from a detailed artist that we can all resonate with.
