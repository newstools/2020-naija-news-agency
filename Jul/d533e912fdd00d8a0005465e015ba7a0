Paul Pogba says four of his Man Utd team-mates “have pushed” him to improve this season following their performances. The World Cup winner has formed an exciting relationship with Bruno Fernandes on the return of football last month, and has significantly contributed to United’s 17-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Prior to that Pogba had struggled to get going this season for Man Utd – who host Southampton on Monday night – with injury ruling him out for most of the season with only nine Premier League starts to his name. MAILBOX: Just how sh*t are Spurs, Arsenal, Everton, Leicester? Fred, Scott McTominay, Nemanja Matic and Andreas Pereira have all taken turns starting in Pogba’s place for most of his absence and he has thanked them for helping him improve. Pogba said in Man Utd’s official matchday programme: “What Fred, Scott, Nemanja, and even Andreas, who isn’t a central midfielder, have done [is] played and given everything and they played well and helped us win games. When I saw this I was very happy and they have pushed me to get better and better. “We are not there yet but we are on the way and if we keep doing what we’re doing now then I think there is nothing that can stop us to get to where we should be.” Pogba on #mufc: ‘We are not there yet but we are on the way and if we keep doing what we’re doing now then I think there is nothing that can stop us to get to where we should be.’ — Samuel Luckhurst (@samuelluckhurst) July 13, 2020 The post Pogba names four Man Utd men who ‘have pushed’ him to improve appeared first on Football365.
