In a letter dated July 17, 2020 addressed to the Inspector-General of Police through her lawyer, Olamide Omileye, she said she was withdrawing from the case for personal reasons. In his response to the letter, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Admin), Umar Sanda, said investigation had discontinued due to lack of evidence. The letter posted on Twitter by blogger, Kemi Olunloyo, read in part, “In view of the foregoing facts, investigation was discontinued as no substantial evidence to prove the allegation of rape against the suspect.” Human rights group, Stand To End Rape Initiative popularly known as STER, said Seyitan decided to end the case without receiving any monetary compensation. Seyitan had accused D’Banj of raping her at Glee Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos in December 2018, an allegation he has denied several times. The singer later sued her for N1.5bn over the allegation, adding that it had caused him untold embarrassment and psychological trauma.
