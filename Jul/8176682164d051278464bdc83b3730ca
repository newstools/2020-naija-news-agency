 Former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi has advised youths to learn more skills that will add value to their lives in the future. He urged governments at all levels to show more seriousness and commitment to vocational and technical education. Obi, who spoke on Wednesday during the celebration of the World Youth Skills Day, noted that government needs to invest heavily in vocational and technical education to secure the future of youths. The former governor said the realities of today’s world have shown that everyone needs some skills to succeed, irrespective of intellectual abilities. According to him, by investing in education, the government will better equip the youth with requisite skills to compete on the international platform. “This is an opportunity for Nigeria to invest heavily in the Education sector. A good investment in Basic Education, both at primary and secondary levels, will empower the youth with requisite skills to be able to compete globally in Science, Technology, ICT, Engineering and other fields of endeavour. “Therefore, governments must look closely at vocational education and strengthen skill acquisition among the youth. The educational curricula of schools should also reflect skill acquisition as an integral part in the formation of productive youth, well equipped for global impacts,” Obi said. Wishing the youth well in their endeavours, the former governor reminded them that their future was in their hands. He advised them to involve themselves in all kinds of productive skills acquisition without waiting for the government to do everything for them. This year’s World Youth Skills Day, with the themed: Skills for a Resilient Youth, was powered by the United Nations, United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and others.
