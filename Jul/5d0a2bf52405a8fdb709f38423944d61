Sarri’s side faces a huge test on Saturday when they host Atalanta, who are third in Serie A and nine points behind leaders Juve with seven games remaining. Manchester City manager Guardiola compared playing Atalanta to going to the dentist, having beaten and drawn with the Italian side in the Champions League group stage. Sarri agreed with Guardiola’s description as he expects a difficult clash against Gian Piero Gasperini’s men. “It’s an important moment of the season. Atalanta are not a surprise. They have done really well throughout the season, particularly away from home,” he told a news conference. “They are a really difficult opponent. Atalanta have been a difficult opponent for everyone for a long time now. “Guardiola gave the best description of them. It’s like going to the dentist. You can end up well but you feel the pain. It’s a really difficult team to face.” Sarri will come up against Guardiola in the Champions League quarter-finals if their respective teams get through their last-16 ties. But the Italian said his focus was on Serie A before a clash with Lyon, who won the first leg of their tie 1-0 in France. “I am not interested. We have only one goal now – the league. And after the league we have Lyon,” Sarri said. “It’s really far away now so we don’t have to waste any energy thinking about it.” Fotmob Vanguard The post Sarri expects difficult challenge as Juve clash with Atalanta appeared first on Vanguard News.
