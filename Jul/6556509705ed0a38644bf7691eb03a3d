Arsenal have this evening posted a fitness update on Mikel Arteta’s squad, ahead of the club’s final two outings of the campaign. The coming week will see Arsenal finish out the remainder of their domestic season. First, on Sunday evening, the north Londoners are set to welcome Watford to the Emirates. The clash is set to come as the respective sides’ last in the Premier League in 2019/20, though the relegation-battling visitors will of course have far more on the line than their mid-table hosts. Instead, Arsenal’s focus will no doubt be lasered in on the FA Cup final a week from tomorrow. Mikel Arteta’s men will go head-to-head with London rivals Chelsea in the domestic cup showpiece, hoping to add to their record haul of 13 titles. A victory would not only see the Gunners clinch their first piece of silverware under Arteta, but also secure their spot in next season’s Europa League, in the process securing much-needed additional funds for the transfer market. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1196188188-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BOURNEMOUTH, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 26: Mikel Arteta, Manager of Arsenal looks on prior to the Premier League match between AFC Bournemouth and Arsenal FC at Vitality Stadium on December 26, 2019 in Bournemouth, United Kingdom.

The main focus surrounds a pair of players, namely Shkodran Mustafi and Bernd Leno. German defender Mustafi picked up a hamstring problem in his side’s FA Cup semi-final downing of Manchester City. And, unfortunately for the 28-year-old, who has looked much improved of late, the issue has seen him ruled out of contention versus Chelsea next weekend: ‘Right hamstring sustained during FA Cup semi-final on Saturday.’ ‘Will miss remaining matches of this season. Further details on recovery programme will be confirmed in the coming days.’ The news on compatriot Leno, on the other hand, is more encouraging. Shot-stopper Leno has been out of action since picking up a nasty-looking knee injury versus Brighton last month. The Arsenal no.1, though, appears to be ahead of schedule in his recovery, amid hope that Leno will be ‘back in full training next week’: ‘Right knee. Sustained moderate ligament sprain during Brighton & Hove Albion (a) on June 20.’ ‘Now participating in outside running and ball drills.’ ‘Aiming to be back in full training next week.’ Shkodran Mustafi will miss the remaining matches of this season.
