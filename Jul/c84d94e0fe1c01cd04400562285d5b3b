 VICE presidential candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), in the last elections, Mr. Peter Obi, has called on Nigerians to remain vigilant and keep adhering to the COVID-19 safety protocols set by different health agencies, noting that the coronavirus pandemic was not yet over and would hit the country hard if people paid deaf ears to COVID-19 guidelines. Obi, who made this known through a statement made available to the press, advised, amidst the lift on inter-state travel ban, that Nigerians should not think that the pandemic is already over. Obi warned that an attempt to throw cautions to the winds in this pandemic might have undesirable implications on the country. He explained that the lift on inter-state travel ban was only a measure taken by the federal government to ease the hardship on people whose source of livelihood depend on that and also to keep the economy alive.
