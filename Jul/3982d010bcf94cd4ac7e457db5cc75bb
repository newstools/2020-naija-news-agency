 A FORMER Special Adviser to ex-Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, Mr. Idowu Ajanaku, has endorsed Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for a second term. This, he said, is predicated on the fact that Akeredolu remains the best bet for the APC to win the governorship election. Ajanaku, who is also from Ondo State, appealed to the aggrieved chieftains, who may have one thing or the other against the governor, to sheathe their swords in the interest of the party and Ondo State in general. He said disagreements are bound to occur in politics, adding that to err is human, but to forgive is divine. “They should forgive and forget,” Ajanaku said. He warned against continuous quarrel that may jeopardise the chances of the party in the coming governorship election because a house divided against itself cannot stand.  Original Article
