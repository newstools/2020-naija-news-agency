The first-half of the 2019/20 campaign was perhaps Marcus Rashford’s best in a Manchester United shirt. The Englishman was scoring goals for fun, and looked unstoppable at times. An injury picked up vs Wolves in January would put an end to Rashford’s fine form, though, with the attacker having only returned to action last month. And since the restart, whilst Rashford hasn’t exactly been playing poorly, the goals have dried up. In his last seven outings across all competitions for the Red Devils, Rashford has netted just once. One man who isn’t overly concerned with Rashford’s lack of goals, though, is teammate Bruno Fernandes. Speaking in a recent interview with Man United’s official website, Fernandes voiced the opinion that Rashford is doing an ‘amazing job’, and will soon rack up more goals and assists: “I think everyone is talking about Marcus not scoring a lot of goals but he is doing an amazing job. “The game he is playing now, maybe he is not achieving his goals and everything but, with everything we are doing now, he will achieve more goals and more assists. In the games, in the complete football, because football is not just about goals and assists, it is about the team and Marcus is playing very well for the team. “Anthony is playing very well and scoring goals, which is what you want as a striker, and Mason is a young kid who is scoring every time in different ways, so you always need to expect something new from him.” Quotes via Manchester United’s official website. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1197966915-1024x624.jpg?resize=1024%2C624&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 01: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on February 1, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.
