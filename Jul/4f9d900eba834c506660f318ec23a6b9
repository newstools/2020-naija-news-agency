Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson thinks Liverpool will win the Premier League title again next season to back up their 2019/20 triumph. The Reds won the Premier League at a canter as they wrapped up the title in record time with seven matches to spare. Jurgen Klopp’s side currently have a lead of 18 points over Manchester City, who pipped them to the title last term, with one game to play while Manchester United and Chelsea are a further 15 points back in third and fourth respectively.

Merson told the Daily Star: “I would be surprised if they [Liverpool] didn’t go on and do it again next season. “Manchester City are a brilliant team, make no mistake and they can blow anyone away on their day. But Liverpool are more consistent. They can win games when they are not playing well and City haven’t been able to do that because their defence hasn’t been as good.’” Merson added: “It’s shame Liverpool had to lift the Premier League trophy in front of an empty stadium at Anfield. “I can remember the last time Liverpool won the title in 1990, because I was in the Arsenal side that did the same thing the following season. Back then you knew if you finished above Liverpool then you’d basically be champions. They were so dominant at that time. “But I think their fans will definitely get the chance to celebrate a Premier League trophy presentation inside Anfield in the future, because this won’t be the last time Liverpool win the title.” The post Merson predicts next season’s Premier League champions appeared first on Football365.
