James Rodriguez is pushing for a move away from Real Madrid this summer with Man Utd interested in his services, according to reports. The Colombian has played just 13 times for Los Blancos this season, not helped by injury issues after returning from a two-year loan at Bayern Munich last summer. He has been linked with a move to Man Utd fairly recently with Real president Florentino Perez reportedly willing accept ‘less than €30m (£26m)’ for Rodriguez.

And now Sport (via Sport Witness) claims that Rodriguez has ‘grown tired’ of Zinedine Zidane’s ‘empty words’ that everyone in his Real Madrid squad is important. Man Utd – who play Southampton on Monday night – are one of the ‘main options’ for the former Monaco playmaker with it looking more and more likely that he will leave the Bernabeu this summer. If Man Utd choose to ‘approach the transfer’ then they will have to ‘respect his salary’ and honour his current €7.75m a year contract at Real Madrid as he doesn’t want to take a pay cut. It would be likely that the fee Man Utd would have to pay the La Liga giants for Rodriguez would be greatly reduced, owing to his current contract status.
