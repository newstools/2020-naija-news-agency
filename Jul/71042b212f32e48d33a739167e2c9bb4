Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has this evening provided an update on the future of soon-to-be out-of-contract attacker Willian. Willian’s future has remained up in the air for some time now. The 31-year-old, who has been plying his trade at Stamford Bridge since 2013, has just weeks remaining on his current Chelsea deal. The Blues are thought to have made repeated efforts to tie Willian down to fresh terms, but, to this point, the former Shakhtar Donetsk man has stood firm in demanding a contract through to 2024. As such, though an agreement over a short-term extension for the remainder of the COVID-19-hit campaign was found, a subsequent divorce has long looked on the cards. A host of clubs have been touted as potential destinations for Willian ahead of next season, with the experienced Brazilian international, as things stand, set to be available as a free agent. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195432203-1024x688.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 22: Willian of Chelsea celebrates after scoring his sides second goal with Cesar Azpilicueta and team mates during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on December 22, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

As outlined above, though, if the latest comments on the part of Frank Lampard are anything to go by, then, somewhat surprisingly, all hope of Willian remaining at Stamford Bridge does not yet appear to be lost. Speaking in a press conference this evening, the Chelsea boss was drawn on the topic of Willian’s future. The Brazilian has been in fine form of late, having notched 5 goals and 2 assists in his last 6 appearances across all competitions, including a brace versus West Ham on Wednesday. And Lampard evidently remains hopeful of such exploits continuing beyond the end of the current campaign, with the English tactician having explained: ‘I haven’t given up hope on it (Willian’s new contract). The club are still in discussions with him. We want him to stay at the club, but I also appreciate this contract for him is a big deal because of his age and where he’s at.’ Lampard continued: ‘I’ve been there before myself, and I respect that. The way he’s playing at the minute, he’s shown his worth to the squad.’ ‘It’s something I hope we can get to, whatever way with Willian, he’s been a great servant to the club, if we can get it I’ll be happy, but if not I’ll certainly wish him well because I’ve got a lot of time for him. It’s ongoing, in short.’ “We want him to stay at the club, but I also appreciate this contract for him is a big deal because of his age and where he’s at.” Where will Willian be playing his football next season? — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) July 3, 2020 Andreas Christensen reaffirms commitment to Chelsea: ‘I’ve never looked anywhere else’ Chelsea & Man City identify Everton’s Lucas Digne as potential left-back target – ESPN Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
