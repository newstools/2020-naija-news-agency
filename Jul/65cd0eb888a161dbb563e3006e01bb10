As many as 5 Argentine stars have this weekend been tipped to join fellow countryman Marcelo Bielsa at Premier League-bound Leeds United this summer. Following a 16-year absence, Leeds’ long awaited return to the top-flight of English football was finally confirmed this past Friday. West Brom’s 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield proved exactly what was needed for the Whites, to make sure of their spot in the Premier League for the 2020/21 campaign. Bielsa’s men have since also been crowned Championship champions, with their victory at Derby earlier today having seen the gap to 2nd-placed West Brom stretched to 8 points. CHAMPIONS!!! @SkyBetChamp — Leeds United (@LUFC) July 18, 2020 As such, while celebrations are no doubt set to carry on for weeks amongst Leeds’ players and staff alike, once the dust settles, attentions will soon switch to building a squad capable of holding their own back at the top of the English game. Marcelo Bielsa will of course be keen to add to the unquestionable talent already at his disposal, to avoid suffering a similar fate to previous Championship holders Norwich City, who are set for a swift return to the 2nd-tier. And, as outlined above, an insight into some of the potential arrivals at Elland Road this summer has this weekend been forthcoming. The report comes courtesy of Argentine outlet Ole, and surprisingly suggests that as many as 5 of Bielsa’s fellow countrymen have been earmarked as potential additions to the Whites’ squad this summer. Out-of-favour Tottenham stopper Juan Foyth is first up, along with fellow central defender Lucas Martinez Quarta, of River Plate. The remainder of the outlined quintet come in the form of attackers, starting out with gifted Racing creative midfielder Matias Zaracho. Stuttgart striker Nicolas Gonzalez, capped 3 times by the Albiceleste, is next up, with highly-regarded 19-year-old Thiago Almada, also rumoured to be on the respective wishlists of the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal, rounding out Leeds’ potential Argentine shopping spree. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1148854939-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA – MAY 12: Thiago Almada of Velez Sarsfield in action during a first leg quarter final match between Velez and Boca Juniors as part of Copa de la Superliga 2019 at Jose Amalfitani Stadium on May 12, 2019 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

As per the reliable Phil Hay, winger Harrison, who has proved an integral member of Marcelo Bielsa’s side once again this season, is set to return to Elland Road from Manchester City on yet another loan next season. This comes ahead of the Peacocks’ expected outright purchase of the 23-year-old next summer. As reported elsewhere yesterday Leeds have agreed to take Jack Harrison on loan from Man City again next season. The original option to sign him permanently was in place until the end of May. It’s been renegotiated and Leeds intend to to exercise it next summer now. #lufc — Phil Hay (@PhilHay_) July 19, 2020 Willian reveals why he’s not signed a new Chelsea deal Mikel Arteta’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang contract update after Arsenal 2 – Man City 0 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
