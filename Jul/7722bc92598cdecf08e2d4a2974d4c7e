Tottenham’s final game of the season sees them travel to Crystal Palace. The Lilywhites, earlier in the campaign, looked extremely unlikely to clinch any form of European football this term. However, after something of an upturn in form under Jose Mourinho, Spurs head into their last game of the campaign with a shot at a Europa League place. The Lilywhites are currently 7th in the English top-flight, which will become a European spot if Chelsea beat Arsenal in the FA Cup final. But should Tottenham beat Crystal Palace on Sunday and Wolves lose to Chelsea, the north London outfit would move up to 6th, which is already a guaranteed Europa League spot. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1211640404-1024x807.jpg?resize=1024%2C807&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jose Mourinho" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEIPZIG, GERMANY – MARCH 10: Jose Mourinho, Manager of Tottenham Hotspur watches on during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second leg match between RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur at Red Bull Arena on March 10, 2020 in Leipzig, Germany.

During the presser, which you could watch in full below, Mourinho was drawn on Spurs’ plans for the summer window. And despite the Lilywhites seemingly being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, Mourinho did appear to hint Tottenham will bring in some players this summer. After stating his side are going in the right direction, the Portuguese tactician went on to claim that Spurs will end with a better, balanced squad: “A new player on Monday would be amazing news, but I think it’s just the opening of the window. “I think we are going in the right direction, very calm, organised, thinking well, measured. I think we are going in the right direction. “We know what we can and cannot do, we know which directions we can and cannot go. We must not be reactive. We are very balanced, together, and have no doubts about what we need and about what is possible. “Step by step, we will end with a better, balanced squad. Of course, keeping the great players that we have is a very important thing.” See also: Leicester City vs Manchester United live streaming & betting tips Chelsea vs Wolverhampton Wanderers live streaming and betting tips Newcastle United vs Liverpool live streaming and betting tips Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
