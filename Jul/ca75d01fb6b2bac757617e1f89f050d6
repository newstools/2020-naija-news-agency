Whilst Arsenal’s 2019/20 hasn’t exactly been great, the Gunners have had a handful of positives along the way. One of the biggest is perhaps the emergence of Bukayo Saka. The Arsenal youth product made his senior debut last season, but it is in the current campaign which Saka has showcased just what a huge player he could be for the north Londoners. Despite being just 18 years of age Saka is already an incredibly versatile player, impressing at left-back, on the left-wing, as a central midfielder and on the right-hand side of midfield. And despite his tender years and the fact he has been played out of position at left-back for the majority of his Arsenal appearances this season, Saka still boasts the best assist record at Arsenal for 2019/20 (11). <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1206671492-1024x703.jpg?resize=1024%2C703&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bukayo Saka" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 16: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal and Valentino Lazaro of Newcastle United during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Newcastle United at Emirates Stadium on February 16, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

London-born Saka has featured at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-19 level for the Three Lions, notching four goals in 10 outings for the latter of those sides. However, despite being born in England and featuring heavily for them at youth level, Saka’s international future is still not set in stone. The Arsenal star is able to play for Nigeria due to his parents, and when discussing his international prospects recently, Saka admitted it will be a tough choice: “It’s a tough choice. “I’m happy to have represented England at youth level but I’m also proud of my Nigerian heritage from my parents. “We haven’t been picked by any team so it’s about staying humble and when the time comes we’ll make the decision.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
