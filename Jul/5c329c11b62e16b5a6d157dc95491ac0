Paul Pogba has recently explained how Manchester United can become a ‘top, top team’. Manchester United have been one of the Premier League’s in-form sides in 2020. United, as of writing, are still able to boast the accolade of being the only team in the English top-flight not to have lost a game since the restart in June. But even before the season was halted United were in top form and are currently on a 16-game unbeaten run across all competitions. However, despite their massive upturn in form, the Red Devils are still well off now Premier League champions, Liverpool, and are actually not even in the top-four. So, if Man United do wish to start challenging the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City again, they need to produce similar form to what they have shown since the restart all year round. And as mentioned above, Paul Pogba has recently told United what they must do to become a top side. Speaking to Man United’s official website, the Frenchman stated the Reds must forget about the last game and start thinking about the next one: “To become a top, top team we just need to forget about the last game. We do it, we play well, we do great but then we forget about it and we think about the next one. “Take last week, we don’t think about what happened, we are focused on going again. We have to always keep having the goal to improve ourselves and never get satisfied with what we did.” Pogba then used Anthony Martial as an example, before adding United are never satisfied with just one trophy or one win: “For example, Martial scored three goals, his first hat-trick, then he goes again, you have to carry on… he wants to take another ball home, you know! [Smiles] You have to have this mentality, score a goal and do it again and again… Bruno, Rashy, Mason… hey if you got two goals, great, but go for three, why not. You have to keep this mentality, keep a clean sheet too… we want to keep working on this and we have the mentality to do it. “That’s also the mentality of this club, it’s always been like that. We’re never satisfied with one trophy or one game we win or two games or 10 games, you want more, you always want more. That’s what makes Manchester United the biggest club, for me, in England.” <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1223645368-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Manchester United’s Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes (L) celebrates scoring their second goal with Manchester United’s French midfielder Paul Pogba (R) during the English Premier League football match between Brighton and Hove Albion and Manchester United at the American Express Community Stadium in Brighton, southern England on June 30, 2020.

And whilst Villa have shown some signs of improvement in recent games, they are still firmly in the relegation scrap and winless since January. As a result, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side should have no problems extending their unbeaten run to 17 games. Find out how to watch the game here.
