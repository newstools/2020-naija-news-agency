After scoring a brace against Crystal Palace last weekend, Jamie Vardy found the target again on Tuesday as Leicester drew 1-1 at Arsenal. Vardy, once a target for Arsenal, has now scored 10 goals in his last 10 games against the Gunners. The Leicester striker moved onto 102 Premier League when he scored 6 minutes from time. Arsenal took the lead in the first-half through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Arsenal were reduced to 10-men midway through the second-half. VAR ultimately made the decision to dismiss Gunners forward Eddie Nketiah after he landed his studs down the calf of Leicester defender James Justin. Nketiah’s foot was high, the contact was reckless, and the red-card seemed wholly justified. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EcWs10bXYAQrF-d.png?ssl=1" alt="Eddie Nketiah sent off for a foul on Justin James" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Eddie Nketiah sent off for a foul on Justin James How long will Eddie Nketiah be banned for? After receiving a straight red card against Leicester, Nketiah is now looking at a 3-game ban. That would mean the striker misses upcoming league games against Tottenham, Liverpool, and then Man City in the FA Cup. However, if Arsenal appeal the decision, then Nketiah’s suspension could be reduced to 2-games. As confirmed in the Sun: Nketiah will now be banned for three matches if Arsenal do not appeal his straight red. And that would see him miss Sunday’s derby clash with Tottenham, as well as the visits of Liverpool and Manchester City next week. On the likelihood of Arsenal’s appeal, Mikel Arteta indicated that the Gunners will lodge the necessary paperwork. In his post match press conference (watch below), Arteta commented: We will look at the options and see how we can be diverse, we will see how long Eddie is suspended and we will adapt. Arteta also argued that Jamie Vardy should have seen a red card on Tuesday night. In the first half, Vardy’s studs connected with Shkodran Mustafi’s face as the opponents collided. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EcWs3lzXsAAFC0E.png?ssl=1" alt="Jamie Vardy vs Shkodran Mustafi" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Jamie Vardy vs Shkodran Mustafi Vardy wasn’t even booked at the time, however, after the game, Arteta voiced his opinion that if Nketiah was sent off, Vardy should have gone too: What I am saying is if you review incidents of that type, you have to review them all. It has to be equal for everyone because it changes the game. If Eddie’s is a red card for sure, so is the other. Also see: Manchester City vs Newcastle United live streaming & betting tips.
