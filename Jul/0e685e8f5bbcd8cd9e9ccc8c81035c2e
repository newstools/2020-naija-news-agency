Nigerian pre-teens will join their peer groups from 5 other countries of the world in the very 1st virtual and international TECH BOOTH-CAMP for kids aged 9-15. The tech-camp will hold online over a 5 week period Monday-Friday starting from August 21st. The key component of this very edition is Web Design, Development and Hosting, participants will learn the A-Z basics of website set up; from web designing, developing, getting domain name, and hosting. Participants will at the end of the program be able to develop a website for their parents’ business and possibly host it on the World Wide Web. Technology is the future of work and a key part of the STEM initiative, Teens Code Club since 2018 have been at the forefront of IT, introducing kids early enough to understanding programming and coding as a core component of the way of life of their youth and adult life tomorrow. As a result of the pandemic, this year will be virtual and as such giving opportunity for teens to attend from the comfort of their homes; learn a new crucial skill, network with peers from a different culture and create a good ground to change their nearly routine online school education schedule that is already boring. The program will develop not only the intuitive sense of participants but also their critical reasoning and creative skills as well as networking, cross multiplication of ideas and cultural exchange as various developmental projects of the program will afford participants to do group work with ‘new friends’ from other regions. Facilitators will come from India (perhaps the IT capital of the world), South Africa, and Nigeria.
