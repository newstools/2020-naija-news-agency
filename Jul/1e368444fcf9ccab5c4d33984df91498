Carlo Ancelotti has recently moved to provide a fresh Everton team news update ahead of their upcoming tie. The current Premier League game week draws to a close on Monday the 6th of July as Everton travel to Tottenham. The Toffees, despite a bit of a blip pre-coronavirus, have been in solid form since the restart. After garnering a hard-fought draw over the now Premier League champions, Liverpool, Everton have picked up back-to-back wins over Norwich and Leicester City. This has moved the Merseyside outfit to within just three points of 7th-place Sheffield United. As a result, Everton will be desperate to get one over on Spurs this weekend to ensure their slim European hopes are kept alive. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1195213434-1024x746.jpg?resize=1024%2C746&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 21: Carlo Ancelotti, Manager of Everton is seen in the stands prior to the Premier League match between Everton FC and Arsenal FC at Goodison Park on December 21, 2019 in Liverpool, United Kingdom.

So, Everton will, of course, be eager to ensure they can field the strongest possible eleven on Monday for what should be a tight affair. One player who did look to be something of a doubt for the Toffees was Richarlison after the Brazilian picked up a knock vs Leicester earlier this week. However, Carlo Ancelotti has since provided a fresh update on Richarlison during his pre-Tottenham presser, stating he believes the attacker will be fine: “Richarlison didn’t train [on Friday] but I think he will be able to train tomorrow and he is not going to have problems to play on Monday. “I think he will be fine. “He has to train on Saturday and Sunday but I think he is recovering well from the knock and he is not going to have problems.” Everton will also have Djibril Sidibe available for selection on Monday: “We also have Djibril Sidibe back for this game, but Theo Walcott and Fabian Delph are out.” See also: Chelsea vs Watford live streaming and betting tips Liverpool FC vs Aston Villa live streaming & betting tips Southampton vs Manchester City live streaming and betting tips Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
