A fresh update regarding the future of Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho has emerged online on Sunday. One of the most persistent transfer stories touted throughout the 2019/20 season has involved Jadon Sancho. The Englishman has been linked with a number of top sides this term, but none more so than Manchester United. Sancho, who scored a staggering 20 goals and provided 20 assists in 44 outings for BVB this term, would prove a sensational addition to a United side somewhat lacking down the right-hand side of their attack. As a result, the Red Devils faithful were no doubt thrilled when the reliable Duncan Castles reported earlier this month that the 11-time capped international had agreed, in principle, personal terms with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s outfit. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1192496995-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho" data-recalc-dims="1" /> DORTMUND, GERMANY – DECEMBER 07: Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund celebrates after scoring his team’s second goal which is later disallowed by VAR during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna Duesseldorf at Signal Iduna Park on December 07, 2019 in Dortmund, Germany.

It has previously been reported that the Bundesliga giants are unwilling to lower their asking price for Sancho, demanding at least £100m. However, claims emerged at the end of June that Man United didn’t want to part with more than £50m to land the wide-man. Despite the rumoured issues surrounding a potential transfer fee, though, Dortmund do appear to be planning for life post-Sancho. As per Duncan Castles, writing for The Times: Borussia Dortmund have begun preparing for Jadon Sancho’s possible sale to Manchester United by lining up a replacement for the England international. The player in question is Lille’s Jonathan Ikone, who is believed to be valued at £41m. Whilst this may have given United hope that Dortmund would accept £50m for Sancho in order to land Ikone for £41m, though, Castles reiterated the stance that BVB want more than £90m for their star man. So, given the fact that Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc claimed earlier this month that the club would be happy to hold on to Sancho, it appears as though Man United will indeed be forced to cough up around £100m, if they truly intend to coax the starlet to Old Trafford. Should the Red Devils miss out on Sancho due to his price, however, one potential alternative to have been touted in the media is Bayern Munich’s Kingsley Coman.
