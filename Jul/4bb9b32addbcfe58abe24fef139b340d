The drive, the consistency, the tenacity, and the stanch devotion towards ensuring that they maintain focus on the goal ahead makes it almost impossible for such brands to go unnoticed. One of such brands with a relentless resolve towards achieving its goal to immensely impact the youths in the society is the premium smartphone maker, Infinix. The Infinix Generation X initiative is majorly focused on empowering young adults to achieve their dreams and become pioneers of brilliant ideas in their respective fields. With this in sight, the brand continues to create cutting edge devices that will serve as valuable tools to young individuals whilst orchestrating several campaigns that challenge and inspires them to be original and creative. It is a well-known fact that Infinix, just like its young and vibrant loyalists, has a unique appreciation for popular culture and all art forms such as music and fashion. As a result, the brand has organized several immensely rewarding activities spanning across these many fields. #ExploreAnotherMe campaign Recently the brand concluded its #ExploreAnotherMe campaign. This campaign followed the launch of its NOTE 7 smartphone; a device that takes the smartphone experience to a new level of awesomeness and seamlessly bridges work and relaxation. Spawning from the understanding of the diversity of human talent, and the fact that many multitalented youths prefer to hide some of their valuable talents whilst projecting only a few, the #ExploreAnotherMe challenge was focused on encouraging youths to put their hidden/least projected talents on the spotlight. Several entries were received during the period of the campaign and the entries with highest support and engagements were duly rewarded with a cash prize of ₦1,000,000. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-15-at-14.54.28.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Empowered by Infinix S4 Campaign Over the years, the brand has organized several other highly rewarding campaigns, one of which was the “Empowered by Infinix S4” activity which ran from April 23rd till May 14th, 2019.
