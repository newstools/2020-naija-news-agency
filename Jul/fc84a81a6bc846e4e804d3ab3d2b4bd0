The singer made the explosive revelation a few weeks ago and stated that he decided to keep the situation of his family a secret. However, Mr P was called out from chasing clout with fake news. However, it appears some people still do not believe that the virus exists and the singer who is preparing for the release of his album “The Prodigal” took to his Twitter page to drop a message for them. He cautioned people to stay safe as they go out, adding that a word is enough for the wise. He wrote: “For those still doubting Covid19. A word is enough for the wise! Stay safe out der. Ignorance is a disease. Far worst than the underlying virus (Covid19) California has gone Shut Down again and some states in the US are about to do the same. Some will still say Covid19 is a Scam. It’s ordinary malaria! Prepare ur mind, cos life might not be normal till nxt yr.” For those still doubting Covid19. A word is enough for the wise!
