Updates on the fitness of both N’Golo Kante and Raul Jimenez have been forthcoming today, ahead of this weekend’s showdown between Chelsea and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Stamford Bridge is set to play host to one of a number of highly-anticipated Premier League final day fixtures this Sunday. With the race for a top-4 berth set to go down to the wire, Chelsea will welcome Nuno Espirito Santo’s Wolves to the capital in a little under 48 hours’ time. The hosts are set to enter the clash occupying the English top-flight’s final Champions League berth. Their defeat at the hands of Liverpool on Wednesday night, though, means that Chelsea still require at least a point to be sure of a spot in the top-4. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1253723769-1024x739.jpg?resize=1024%2C739&#038;ssl=1" alt="Frank Lampard" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JULY 01: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea reacts during the Premier League match between West Ham United and Chelsea FC at London Stadium on July 01, 2020 in London, England.

As things stand, the West Midlands-based outfit sit 6th in the Premier League table. The tight nature of the battle for Europe, though, means that Nuno’s men could yet be leapfrogged by Tottenham on the final day. This, coupled with Arsenal beating Chelsea in the FA Cup final, would then see Wolves miss out on a Europa League place altogether. As such, ahead of Sunday’s Stamford Bridge showdown, Frank Lampard and Nuno Espirito Santo this afternoon held press conferences, during which the tacticians provided fitness updates on their respective squads. First up was the former, with the key takeaway regarding Chelsea’s squad having come in the form of confirmation that N’Golo Kante could feature versus Wolves. The French midfielder has been sidelined since picking up a hamstring injury versus Watford at the beginning of the month, but Lampard explained: ‘There is a possibility he will feature. He’s trained for the first time towards a match pace so it’s a decision I will have to make.’ Lampard says Kante might feature against Wolves for #CFC. Is back in training. — Simon Johnson (@SJohnsonSport) July 24, 2020 When it came to the visitors’ squad, meanwhile, the focus very much centered on Raul Jimenez. Wolves’ top-scorer was previously labelled as a doubt to lead the line for his side on Sunday, in anticipation of the birth of his daughter. However, Nuno this afternoon confirmed that Jimenez will be available for selection, after ‘everything went well’ with partner Daniela Basso in the arrival of their first child together: Raul Jimenez is “ready to go” after his partner gave birth earlier this week. “Everything went well with the baby.” Table |  https://t.co/4KiAUTZjCa#Wolves #CFC https://t.co/VLXBCF3WYZ — Ben Dinnery (@BenDinnery) July 24, 2020 Chelsea vs Wolverhampton Wanderers live streaming and betting tips Chelsea reportedly back in hunt for Alex Telles/Blues starlet Iling set for Juventus Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
