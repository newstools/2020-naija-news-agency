With my own vibe, I present you a revamp of the old hymn “I am thine Oh Lord” by Fanny Crosby and I call it “Nearer”.
This is the song I pray with and it is my intimate song with God during this Corona/Covid19 crisis.
If I can just stay nearer to HIM, I know I would be ok. If the whole world would be closer to Him, be humble and pray for more intimacy with Him, we will all be ok".
