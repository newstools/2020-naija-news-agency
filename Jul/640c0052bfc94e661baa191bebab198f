The rapper who has been securing the bags lately broke the internet via his Twitter page where he wrote that he wants to run president in 2020. This is coming four months before the election and apparently without having registered with the Federal Election Commission or even started a campaign committee. He wrote: “We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States,” the rapper wrote on Independence Day, using the hashtag “2020 vision.” We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future.
