 REPENTANT militants in Ondo State have given Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu seven-day ultimatum to settle their entitlements. The ex-militants, under the aegis of ‘Action Crocodile Group’, led by Gen. Bowei Felix (aka Kakadukuduku 1 of the Niger Delta), at a news briefing in Ore, Odigbo Local Government, expressed the need for the federal and state governments to involve concerned groups in the amnesty programme. At the meeting were other ex-militant leaders, including’ Generals’ Akpodinwomi George, Agbala Pouye, Lady Unu (Woman General), Chief Ogidogo, Soriwen Raphael, Chris Iteghi, Bekwei Iyaboerigha and Ebisco Serum, among others. They said federal and state governments introduced the amnesty programme and mandated groups of ex-militants to embrace the scheme since its inauguration in 2017. The group recalled that at that time, offensive weapons in their possession were submitted to the Ondo State Government with a promise to put them on its payroll. This was to take care of them in order to quit the creeks. They said: “It is unfortunate that the current administration promised to cater for all of us, but surprisingly, it deviated by paying some of us, leaving the majority to their plight. “Imagine, rice, money and vehicles were distributed to some of the militant groups, while many were neglected during the last Christmas and Easter.” The ex-militants urged the government to bring the militant groups together and settle their entitlements, for peace to reign.  They enjoined Governor Akeredolu to fix a date for a round-table dialogue with them and release N20million for their welfare and that of their families. The former militants said the meeting was to let the public know of their current predicament, warning that they would not allow the government’s election campaign train in Ese-Odo Local Government if their demands were not met. They urged security operatives to keep abreast of the current development.  Original Article
