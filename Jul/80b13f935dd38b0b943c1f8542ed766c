Thiago has been a mainstay in Bayern Munich’s side since swapping the Camp Nou for the Allianz Arena in 2013. The now 29-year-old has notched over 230 appearances for the Munich-based outfit, clinching countless trophies along the way. And whilst Thiago did suffer some injury troubles in 2019/20, he still garnered 24 league outings as Bayern cruised to yet another league title. However, despite still being a key feature for the Bundesliga champions, Thiago, who has just less than a year left on his current deal, seems to be eyeing the exit door. Speaking earlier this month Bayern’s CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, confirmed that Thiago wants to leave the club. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1131978183-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MUNICH, GERMANY – FEBRUARY 23: Thiago of FC Bayern Muenchen looks on during the Bundesliga match between FC Bayern Muenchen and Hertha BSC at Allianz Arena on February 23, 2019 in Munich, Germany.

The weeks since, however, have seen a whole host of conflicting rumours emerge regarding Thiago. Transfer expert Guillem Balague reported on July 7th that Thiago wants to move to one of Liverpool, Manchester United or Arsenal. But Balague also moved to play down Thiago’s links to Anfield, claiming Liverpool aren’t really looking to spend this summer. It has since been claimed by Bild that Jurgen Klopp has informed Liverpool’s board that he wants Thiago for the upcoming season. But on the same day, David Lynch of the Evening Standard stated that Liverpool will not sign the Bayern man unless one of Liverpool’s current midfielders leaves. Now, Rummenigge has once again been speaking about Thiago. And this time the CEO stated that no club has contacted them over the midfielder: “Hasan had talks with Thiago. They were always very positive, but he told Hasan some time ago that he wants to do something new to finish his career. “So far no club has contacted us. We don’t know if he’s settled things with a new club.” So, for now at least, it doesn’t appear as though Liverpool have any real concrete interest in Thiago. And in terms of the other two Premier League sides claimed (by Balague) to be of interest to Thiago – Man United with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba, don’t appear to be crying out for another playmaker. As for Arsenal, they don’t look to be in the best financial position at the moment. And should the Gunners indeed move for a midfielder in the summer, one with a more defensive mind than Thiago appears to be what they are eyeing with both Thomas Partey and Danilo Pereira linked.
