Perhaps the most notable Premier League clash set to take place this Sunday will see Manchester United make the trip to the King Power Stadium. The tie, of course, is hugely important for both outfits, as it will decide their respective European fates for next season. Leicester City, for much of the campaign, looked nailed on to secure a top-four berth. As for Man United, they looked set for another Europa League finish. However, the Foxes’ form tailing off, coupled with United’s impressive unbeaten run, has seen the latter jump to 3rd in the Premier League table. As such, anything other than a defeat on Sunday will see the Red Devils secure a spot in Europe’s premiere club competition. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1257634886-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – JULY 22: Mason Greenwood of Manchester United in action during the Premier League match between Manchester United and West Ham United at Old Trafford on July 22, 2020 in Manchester, England.

However, whilst that stat, on the surface, looks impressive, those who watch United on a regular basis will be well aware that their performances have dipped of late. This, for the most part, appears to have been down to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer using pretty much the same starting XI for weeks on end. And when the Norwegian has opted to make changes, those on the fringes at United simply haven’t stepped up. Fatigue on the part of Paul Pogba and more has become very apparent of late, with the Reds’ 1-1 draw with West Ham on Sunday a particularly sluggish affair devoid of any real tempo. However, with Man United now afforded a three-day break before Leicester, Solskjaer has assured that his side will be 100 per cent fresh on Sunday: “We’ve not been dealt the best of hands with the recovery times in the last couple of weeks but that’s because we’ve been in the FA Cup. That’s how it is but we’ve got three days now… the extra day before Sunday will make us 100-per-cent fresh. “We’ve given ourselves a great opportunity. We wanted to give ourselves the chance to head there and get into the Champions League by beating them. Now, we’d be OK with a draw, but we’ll be going there to win. You’ll prepare as you always do to go and win the game.” Quotes via Sky Sports News.
