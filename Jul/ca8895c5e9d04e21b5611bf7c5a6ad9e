He studied purchasing and supply at Kwara State Polytechnic. The singles; ‘If Only’, ‘Koko Bi Chicken’, ‘Daddy Mi’, ‘Tesojue’, ‘Government’, ‘2Mussh’, ‘Local Rappers’, ‘Asalamalekun’, ‘Diet’ and ‘Ponmile’ gave him Accolades. Which also earned Reminisce the OG title he carries now and Alaga Ibile. Reminisce have dropped the following music projects; ‘Book Of Rap Stories’ (album), ‘Alaga Ibile’ (album), ‘Baba Hafusa’ (album), ‘El Hadj’ (album) and Ponmile EP (a project that housed 6 different Remixes of his 2017 hit song “Ponmile“). “Vibes & Insha Allah” will be his second released EP and this sure would do better than ‘Ponmile EP’ cos of the EP’s originality, structure and production.
