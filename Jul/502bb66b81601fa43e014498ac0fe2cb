The 23-year-old who grew up in Kaduna State started her journey as a military official from a young age when she started her education at the Nigerian Airforce Primary School in Kaduna. She went on to the Airforce Secondary School and had always known that she wanted to be a member of the Nigerian military. On September 22 2012, Tolulope started at the Nigerian Defence Academy. On September 16, 2017, at the young age of 20, Tolulope was commissioned into the Nigerian Airforce (NAF) and after a little over two years in service she was decorated by the Chief of the Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar as the first female combat helicopter pilot in the history of the Nigerian Air Force. Sadly, less than a year later, it’s been reported that Tolulope Arotile was killed in a road accident at the Nigerian Air Force base in Kaduna State. The loss of such a promising young Nigerian is devastating to say the least. In a statement released by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) via Twitter, Arotile was described as having had a “short but impactful stay in the Service.” See tweets below: 2/4. as a result of head injuries sustained from a road traffic accident at NAF Base Kaduna. Until her death, Fg Offr Arotile, who was commissioned into the NAF in Sept 2017 as a member of @HQ_NDA  RC 64, was the first ever female combat helicopter pilot in the Service. pic.twitter.com/4rhbdNP60D — Nigerian Air Force (@NigAirForce) July 14, 2020 4/4. @CAS_AMSadique  on behalf officers, airmen, airwomen and civilian staff of the NAF, commiserates with the family of late Flying Officer Arotile over this irreparable loss.
