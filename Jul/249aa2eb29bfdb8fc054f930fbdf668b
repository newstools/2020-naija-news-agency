Today we are enjoying Rita and Bright‘s beautiful story. The Ghanaian couple met in their third year at the university and started dating in their fourth year. Now they are ready to spend forever together. They started by creating this memorable pre-wedding session captured by iRed Photography at the Kempinski Hotel Accra. Here’s a little backstory of how they met <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.02.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.03.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.07.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> How We MetBy the bride, Rita It’s not the usual love story. It wasn’t love at first sight. It wasn’t a whirlwind romance. It was a slow, steady and beautiful burn. We met during our 3rd year at University and although I initially rejected his advances. Our friendship blossomed and we finally started dating in our 4th year. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.12.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.31.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.29.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.30.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.32.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.38.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Our Proposal StoryBy the groom, Bright I wanted the proposal to be special and so I flew her to South Africa and proposed to her on the beach.

Once it is done, it’s done… and so I’ve learned to do the same with him. We have chosen to love each other, we have chosen to weather whatever may come our way together and we know with the strength of God and our love for each other we will prevail.- Rita. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.34.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.35.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.15.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.14.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.11.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.40.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bright-Dede-BellaNaija-Weddings.39.jpg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Credits Photography: @iredphotographyPlanner: @stylishsuenoMakeup: @glamtouch9Dress: @yoli_koomsonSuit:: @fiifi_yeboahHair: @prikelshairltdVideography: @blaqeyeconceptghVenue: @kempinskiaccra The post Our Love Started in The University!
