Segalink explained that the police simply acted as intercessors in the case. He added that the documents generated in that regard with the consent of Seyitan’s lawyer and mother would prove his claims. However, D’banj via his Twitter page reacted to a story published by the Guardian and told the activist to tell the truth because he knows what actually transpired between Seyitan and the police. Dbanj said these same people were the ones who sold the fake story to look good for their international NGOs.
