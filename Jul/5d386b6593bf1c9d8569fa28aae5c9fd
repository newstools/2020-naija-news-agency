He also revealed that he had been trying to divorce Kim for over two years after she met up with American rapper, Meek Mill at a hotel. Kim responded by releasing a statement explaining that the rapper was suffering from a bipolar disorder and also urged the public to help him. A few hours ago, the rapper took to his Twitter page to pen down a short apology to his wife. He wrote: “I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me. Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me.
