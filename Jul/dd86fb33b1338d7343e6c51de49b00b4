Speculation in Portugal today has outlandishly suggested that Premier League giants Arsenal are on the verge of signing Sporting CP starlet Joelson Fernandes. Fernandes, 17, has long been viewed as one of Portuguese football’s standout talents. The winger is a product of Sporting CP’s famed academy, and recently became the youngest player to ever represent the capital giants in a competitive fixture. He has since gone on to line out for Sporting’s senior side on a further pair of occasions, though it is Fernandes’ displays as part of the club’s U23 setup which have seen him truly begin to turn heads across Europe. Despite having only turned 17 in February, the gifted attacker managed 5 goals and 2 assists across 28 appearances in the Liga Revelacao this past season. In fact, so impressive has Fernandes looked over the course of the last couple of years, that he has been dubbed the ‘new Cristiano Ronaldo’. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1185337894-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> (L-R), Joelson Fernandes of Sporting CP, Jorrit Hendrix of PSV, Valentin Rosier of Sporting CP during the UEFA Europa League group D match between Sporting Club de Portugal and PSV Eindhoven at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on November 28, 2019 in Lisbon, Portugal(Photo by ANP Sport via Getty Images) As such, Fernandes’ eye-catching talents have inevitably begun to attract the interest of some of Europe’s heavyweights. The likes of Barcelona and Juventus are both thought to be keeping a close eye on the Portuguese youth international’s situation. As outlined above, though, it is one of the Premier League’s giants who are reportedly not only leading the race for Fernandes, but may in fact be just details away from clinching his signature. The outfit in question? Arsenal. According to A Bola in Fernandes’ home country of Portugal, the Gunners are ‘on the verge’ of activating the Sporting star’s release clause, worth £41 million. This comes with super-agent Kia Joorabchian, who has close ties with Arsenal director Edu, orchestrating proceedings behind the scenes. According to @abolapt, #Arsenal are on the verge of activating Sporting Lisbon winger Joelson’s €45m release clause. https://t.co/xP26w1lNED — Gurjit (@GurjitAFC) July 18, 2020 This story, for obvious reasons, though, should be taken with a pinch of salt. Arsenal are not exactly thought to be flush with cash ahead of the opening of the summer transfer window, making the north Londoners prioritising a big-money offer for a relatively unproven teenage winger a little difficult to fathom at this point in time.
