Hushpuppi’s lawyer, Gal Pissetzky, has accused the FBI of kidnapping his client in Dubai and taken him to the U.S.<img src="https://i2.wp.com/instablog9ja.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instablog9ja_20200710_30.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024" /> According to him, Hushpuppi, who posts on Instagram about his extravagant lifestyle, was not a criminal and had made his money legitimately. “He is a social media influencer with millions of followers, with millions of people that respect and loved him, and he loved them, and that’s what he did. In today’s society, that’s a business,” he said. Pissetzky told BBC that: “In my opinion, the FBI and the government here acted illegally when they kidnapped him from Dubai without any legal process to do so. There was no extradition, there were no legal steps taken, there were no court documents filed, it was simply a call to the FBI. He is not a citizen of the United States, the US had absolutely no authority to take him. If Dubai wanted to expel him, they should have expelled him back to Nigeria. I’ve never heard of anything like that. That is the real story here.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
