The latest word stemming from Portugal today suggests that Chelsea, alongside another pair of Premier League clubs, are eyeing up the signature of Porto star Alex Telles. Telles, a 27-year-old left-back, has been plying his trade at the Estádio do Dragão since 2016. On the back of a difficult couple of seasons spent in Turkey and Italy, Porto opted to hand Telles another opportunity to prove himself in Europe. And to say that the Brazilian has since gone on to take full advantage of this chance would be putting it lightly. Telles has rediscovered his brilliant best whilst in Portugal, with the Juventude youth product having established himself as one of the most productive full-backs not only in the Primeira Liga, but across all of European football. The Porto star’s wand of a left foot has long proven a nightmare to deal with for opposing backlines, as evidenced by Telles’ staggering haul of 23 goals and 45 assists across all competitions over the last 3 seasons combined (including 2019/20). As such, Telles’ talents have inevitably resulted in long-standing speculation that the stopper is being eyed up by some of Europe’s heavyweights. In truth, it has come as something of a surprise that the 27-year-old has not yet been pried away from Iberia. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1211130023-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> PORTO, PORTUGAL – MARCH 07: Alex Telles of FC Porto looks on during the Liga Nos match between FC Porto and Rio Ave FC at Estadio do Dragao on March 07, 2020 in Porto, Portugal.

This comes with the former Inter Milan man’s contract at the Estádio do Dragão set to expire next summer, and his current employers no doubt keen to secure some form of return for his services. To this point, the outfit most persistently touted as a potential destination for Telles ahead of next season have been Chelsea. A host of reports earlier this year named the Blues as keen suitors of the South American, with Frank Lampard thought to be on the lookout for reinforcements at left-back. Chelsea’s hopes, though, appeared to have been brought to a definitive end in May, when Portuguese outlet A Bola definitively claimed that Telles was in fact set to join Ligue 1 champions PSG this summer. An agreement between the capital giants and Porto was said to have been ‘closed’, with the announcement of a €25 million deal having been expected following the campaign’s end. As outlined above, however, yet another twist in the situation surrounding Telles’ future has today been forthcoming. As per the reliable Sport Witness (citing Record), as expected, ‘everything indicates’ that the gifted full-back is set to be on the move this summer. Significantly, though, the most likely destination cited is not the French capital. Instead, it is suggested that the strong ties between Telles’ agent, Pini Zahavi, and a number of English clubs, mean that the Porto standout looks destined to be plying his trade in the Premier League next season. In turn, it is claimed that 3 English heavyweights are eyeing Telles’ signature. The clubs in question? Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City. A €25 million fee is once again touted, with it now remaining to be seen which of the aforementioned trio are ready to meet Porto’s demands. In other Chelsea-related transfer news, meanwhile, one of the club’s young talents looks set for an imminent move to Italy. As revealed by Juventus transfer supremo Romeo Agresti, Samuel Iling, a highly-regarded 16-year-old midfielder, is ready to swap London for Turin. Following recent discussions with the Bianconeri’s transfer chiefs, a summer move now appears just details from completion.
