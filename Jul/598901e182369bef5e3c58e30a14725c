A fresh update regarding Manchester United’s alleged pursuit of Jadon Sancho has emerged from Germany on Tuesday. One of the players most persistently linked with a summer move in recent months has, of course, been Jadon Sancho. All of Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, are said to have shown interest in the 20-year-old. This shouldn’t come as too much of a shock, though, given what a top talent the Borussia Dortmund man has become in the last few campaigns. 2019/20, for example, saw the Watford youth notch a staggering 17 goals and 17 assists in 32 Bundesliga outings. A goal contribution record only bettered by Robert Lewandowski and Timo Werner. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1200824539-1024x677.jpg?resize=1024%2C677&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Dortmund’s English midfielder Jadon Sancho celebrate scoring during the German first division Bundesliga football match BVB Borussia Dortmund vs Eintracht Frankfurt, in Dortmund, western Germany on February 14, 2020.

It was reported back in May by the reliable David Ornstein that there is a very high chance Sancho will depart Signal Iduna Park in the summer, with United said to have been in regular contact with BVB to reiterate their interest in the winger. The Red Devils then looked to have taken a huge step forward in their pursuit of Sancho earlier this month. It was claimed that Sancho had agreed, in principle, a five-year contract with the Manchester powerhouse which will pay him an initial £140,000-a-week. That same report would, however, also mention that United do not want to pay more than £50m for the winger, less than half of what Dortmund are said to value Sancho at. Now, as mentioned above, a fresh update concerning Sancho and United has been forthcoming on Tuesday. As per Bild’s Christian Falk, the Bundesliga giants have set Man United an ultimatum regarding any potential transfer of Sancho. Falk alleges that should United want to bid for Sancho, the deal must be done by the 10th of August. Update @Sanchooo10: Ultimatum from @BVB to @ManUtd.
