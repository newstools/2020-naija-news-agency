Now co-organized with Valaida Fullwood of The Soul of Philanthropy and Tracey Webb of Black Benefactors, Black Philanthropy Month has become an innational movement. The United Nations and over 30 governmental bodies have declared every August Black Philanthropy Month. Combining sophisticated social media with in-person and virtual events organized by changemakers in cities all over the world, to date 17 million people have celebrated BPM. Today, BPM is more important than ever, as the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and anti-Black racism have decimated communities everywhere. This global celebration and social action initiative promotes a culture of giving and mutual support year-round to buoy the spirits and capacity of stressed Black communities to recover and rebuild. Black people worldwide give billions in philanthropy, and there is a growing social impact investing and venture funding movement, too. Despite our longstanding and determined leadership to help ourselves, it is well documented that our Black-led nonprofits and businesses have been chronically underfunded by the private sector. Equitable funding is a racial justice issue. A monumental funding investment will be required for Black communities to rebuild post-COVID. In response, BPM organizers are convening a series of three virtual events over four dates during August 2020. These convenings, and every discussion, are designed to mobilize Black philanthropists, social and angel investors, venture capitalists as well as non-Black allies, along with leaders of nonprofits, businesses, communities and movements to create a set of shared funding guidelines for effective Black community rebuilding. The WISE Fund will coordinate follow-up implementation of BPM Summit recommendations and action steps in collaboration with partners and attendees over the next year. The Summit uses a high-tech, interactive platform that simulates a global Black conference location to provide an Afro-futuristic sense of place that stirs an immersive visceral experience and healing. The platform and design elements are crucial for Black people experiencing social isolation, severe illness, death, financial distress, heightened anxiety and anti-Black hostilities during the COVID era. Black Giving and Beyond is a global, virtual convening with three distinct events over four dates (August 1st, 4th, 5th and 29th). Each event is designed to cultivate community and identify actionable principles for equitable, impactful funding of Black communities ravaged by racism and COVID. Live events based on US and African time zones, along with recordings accessible after each live event, allow the entire world and Black Diaspora to participate. Day 1: Global BPM Kickoff, August 1st, 2020 (12:30 PM – 8:30 PM EDT/9:30 AM – 5:30 PM PDT)Three influential leaders deliver keynotes with respondent panel discussions.

Days 2 and 3: Black Philanthropy Month – Africa, August 4th and 5th, 2020 (2 PM – 6 PM WAT)Led by the continent’s most prominent funders, a keynote and respondent panel will spotlight strategies that are working to address COVID and leapfrog Africa’s development.

At the same time, promising Indigenous solutions have emerged from Black-led and serving organizations. The opening session speakers will highlight ways that funders (philanthropic, social impact and others) can best sustain and even scale the many promising homegrown approaches and organizations that have emerged, using the crisis as an opportunity to promote equitable development.

COVID-19 and the resulting pandemic recession could turn back the clock on Africa’s development, or it could be used as a unique chance to accelerate and scale African-made solutions to the continent’s greatest challenges. The choice is ours. Day 2 of BPM 2020’s Africa Summit will highlight how COVID Era innovations from Africa and its Diaspora today can create a better future for tomorrow. To survive and thrive through the global pandemic and recession, Black communities everywhere need an integrated COVID-19 funding approach with a culturally specific lens that uses philanthropy and social investment to rebuild our communities and economies. The Summit will end with recommendation of New Black Funding Principles for just, sustainable post-COVID recovery in Africa and its Diaspora.
