 House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has called for stiffer punishment against rapists and other sexual violence offenders in the country. The Speaker, who spoke on Wednesday in Abuja when he hosted Movement Against Rape and Sexual Violence (MARS-V), led by the wife of Kaduna State governor, Hajiya Aisha Ummi el-Rufai, also called for a prompt review of the nation’s laws on rape. He said existing laws on the sexual offence are too weak. Gbajabiamila noted that Nigerian leaders and the citizenry must rise against rape, which he described as a pandemic that must be attended to, just like the dreaded Coronavirus. The Speaker said every stratum of the society, including the media, has a role to play in the fight against the rape pandemic, adding that statistics on rape cases in Nigeria was “mind-boggling”. According to him, Nigerians, especially those with religious views on rape, need adequate education and awareness against the sexual offence. He said: “Whilst I see so many women here with you, this is a fight not just for women. I can see some few men too. But this is a fight for all. Let a subliminal message be sent that even though over 95 per cent of the victims are women, let it be that it’s we, the men, that are championing your course.” Hajia el-Rufai said rape was becoming alarming and required urgent action to fight its spread. She said the movement was in the National Assembly to seek help, ask questions, seek justice and challenge the status quo. The activist quoted statistics that 717 reported rape cases and 7,170 unreported ones occurred in Nigeria within five months.  Original Article
