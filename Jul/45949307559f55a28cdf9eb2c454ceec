Her music is a platform that spreads a simple message: worship God in spirit and truth, He is always there, no matter how rough the road is.

I am here to serve in leading others to discover the spirit and truth of God’s saving grace. It is my prayer that the song will resonate with listeners and they will come to understand the safety in abiding in the presence of God. Hiding Place is not a place of hiding but a place of prayer, love, power, and grace.” “Hiding Place” will be available on all major streaming platforms, including iTunes, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Pandora, and more.
