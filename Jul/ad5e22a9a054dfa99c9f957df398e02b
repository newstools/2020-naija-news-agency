In the video, D’banj had called fo the lady to be rescued immediately and jumped from the stage to attend to her himself. The singer reacted to this and stated he has always respected and honored women. He also threw shade at Kiki Mordi and Ayodeji Osowobi for not getting their facts right before making bogus claims about him. I have Always Respected and Honored Women. If this So called feminist had done their home work well they would know but Greed and free NGO funding won’t let them get facts @kikimordi @AyodejiOsowobi https://t.co/MEzWBFh4AO — D’banj D Kokomaster (@iamdbanj) July 5, 2020 Another fan had asked him if he was going to be doing a giveaway for his fans after he receives the 1.5bn lawsuit against Seyitan. He responded saying he would ensure that the funds would be used for real victims of rape and the helpless. Ofcourse I will, For the Real Victims of Rape and the Helpless. @kikimordi @AyodejiOsowobi https://t.co/m8kWTwLZnD — D’banj D Kokomaster (@iamdbanj) July 5, 2020 The post “I’ll Use My 1.5 Billion Naira Lawsuit Proceeds For Giveaway & To Help Real Rape Victims” – D’Banj Tells Fans appeared first on tooXclusive.
