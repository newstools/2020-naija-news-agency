Mikel Arteta was this evening drawn on the possibility of either Mesut Ozil or Matteo Guendouzi returning to the fold for Arsenal’s upcoming meeting with Leicester. Following a short break, the Gunners are set to return to action on Tuesday night. Arteta’s men will welcome Leicester to the Emirates for a hotly-anticipated Premier League clash. Arsenal will no doubt head into proceedings brimming with confidence, on the back of a stellar spell of recent form. After falling to respective defeats in their first two outings following the resumption of English football last month, the north Londoners have since gone on to rack up 4 straight victories. The latest of these proved the most impressive, with a trip to Molineux on Saturday evening having eventually seen Arsenal emerge with a deserved 2-0 win. The Gunners’ upcoming opponents, though, are also no doubt set to provide a stern test. Leicester, following a worrying blip of their own, got back to winning ways yesterday, with a 3-0 downing of Crystal Palace at the King Power. As such, ahead of his side’s meeting with the Foxes in 48 hours’ time, Mikel Arteta this evening held a pre-match press conference. The Arsenal boss was drawn on a whole host of topics, including Alexandre Lacazette’s much needed goal versus Wolves, and Jamie Vardy’s incredible record in front of goal at the age of 33. Perhaps the most noteworthy takeaway from Arteta’s presser, though, surrounded an update on the respective situations of Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1195399077-1024x833.jpg?resize=1024%2C833&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 22: Arsenal Head Coach Mikel Arteta with Matteo Guendouzi during a training session at London Colney on December 22, 2019 in St Albans, England.

Guendouzi, meanwhile, last lined out versus Brighton last month, with an unnecessary outburst (and subsequent claims of insults towards the Seagulls’ players) following the full-time whistle at the Amex having seen the young Frenchman dropped ever since. And, if the latest comments on the part of Arteta are anything to go by, then it does not look as though either of the aforementioned pair will be making a return to the pitch on Tuesday night: ‘Still, the situation is as it was before,’ the Arsenal boss explained. @m8arteta held another press conference earlier this evening… Read everything he had to say ahead of #ARSLEI — Arsenal (@Arsenal) July 5, 2020 Arsenal vs Leicester City live streaming and betting tips Mikel Arteta assesses Arsenal’s Champions League hopes before Leicester Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
