This new version features Nigeria born Reggae/Dancehall artist- Patoranking, members of the Marley family as well as other artists from around the world who lend their voices to the cause against coronavirus and its ripple effects. This global project will raise funds to support children in developing countries, where help is urgently needed. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Pato-for-One-Love-Remake.jpeg?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The remake passes a deeper message much needed at this time with the aid of the different textures and sounds of the original Bob Marley influence alongside the wealth of variety from the other artists.
