Mikel Arteta has been in the Arsenal dugout for just over six months now. The Spaniard inherited a side devoid of confidence will no real game plan. Arsenal also had their fair shy of players either past their best or simply not up to scratch. Six months ago, for example, every Gunners fan would have no doubt been extremely keen to see the back of players such as David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi and maybe even to some extent, Granit Xhaka and Alexandre Lacazette. The north Londoners have been on the decline for some time now with their failure to replace Arsene Wenger properly only increasing that downward spiral. Under Arteta, however, Arsenal have looked a completely different side. The Spaniard has tightened up their previously awful defence, getting some superb displays out of the aforementioned Luiz and Mustafi. Arsenal also finally look to have a clear vision going forward with the players actually seemingly keen to give their all for Arteta. Yes, Arsenal did finish 8th in the Premier League, their lowest since the 1994/95 campaign. But it’s still pretty apparent that Arteta, who has already guided Arsenal to some silverware, can help transform them into a top-four side once again, if given the backing. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227874294-1024x666.jpg?resize=1024%2C666&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 01: Mikel Arteta manager of Arsenal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal pose with the trophy after the FA Cup Final match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Wembley Stadium on August 1, 2020 in London, England.

So, if Arsenal do want to stand any chance of challenging the likes of Manchester City and Arsenal in the future, somewhat of a rebuild at the Emirates will likely be needed. There problem there, though, is Arsenal, due to Covid-19, just don’t appear to have the funds to make big signings in the near future. Arsenal will get some extra cash now they have managed to clinch Europa League football, but it still isn’t anywhere near what they would have received from a Champions League spot. Therefore, if Arteta and co. want to bring in a number of fresh faces this summer, you would assume there would have to be a fair few outings to help fund said transfers. With this in mind, here are five players Arsenal could look to sell in order to help rebuild their squad. Perhaps the most obvious player Arsenal should look to sell is Mesut Ozil. Since penning fresh terms worth a staggering £350,000-a-week in 2018, the German’s form has fallen off a cliff. And since the Premier League restarted in June, Ozil has not featured once for Arsenal. So, with the former Real Madrid standout clearly not in Arteta’s plans going forward, moving him on would certainly be in the Gunners’ best interests. However, that is easier said that done. As mentioned above, the German is on a pretty substantial wage, which most sides would unlikely be willing or unable to match. Ozil also has a year left on his contract with his agent recently stating his client will remain at the Emirates until 2021. So, whilst a transfer in the summer does seem unlikely, Arsenal should at least look to loan the midfielder out for the season before he leaves on a free. They are unlikely to find someone willing to pay Ozil’s full £350,000-a-week. But even if they receive some form of loan fee or get a side to pay half his wages for a year it would no doubt help out massively. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

Like Ozil, the Frenchman has been frozen out by Arteta of late, but unlikel his midfield counterpart, Guendouzi looks to have a fair few potential suitors. Guendouzi was a fairly regular feature under Arteta and started their first two league ties after the restart. However, after grabbing the throat of Brighton’s Neal Maupay during a 2-1 loss in June, Guendouzi was also accused of taunting the Seagulls’ players over pay. Another crazy ending!

And given he is only 21 and still has just under two years left on his current deal, Arsenal should be able to get something of a decent fee for Guendouzi. Barcelona, Inter Milan, Manchester United and Juventus are amongst the clubs to have been touted as potential landing spots for the Frenchman. Arsenal are unlikely to be garnering a premium fee for Sokratis, but they should still look to move him on this summer. The Greek has been a decent centre-half for the Gunners in recent seasons. But like the players mentioned above, he just doesn’t seem to fit in Arteta’s plans going forward. Sokratis has played a total of three minutes of football since the restart, failing to make a single league appearance. And with the Greek now 32 and having less than a year left on his deal, it would be wise of the Gunners to try and recoup some sort of fee for the out of favour defender in the summer, rather than losing him for nothing next year. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1193140662-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 11: Sokratis Papastathopoulos of Arsenal FC during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Arsenal FC at Selhurst Park on January 11, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The energetic midfielder has since gone on to enjoy a decent spell in north London, though he never really seems to have fully settled in. Pablo Bentancur, Torreira’s agent, has previously suggested that his client was unhappy with a position change during Unai Emery’s stint in the Arsenal dugout. Bentancur has also stated more recently that Torreira ‘would love to return to Italy’. The 24-year-old has even been linked with a number of Italian sides since arriving in the English capital, with AC Milan and Napoli the sides most persistently tipped to move for Torreira. It’s also worth noting that Arteta doesn’t appear to view Torreira as a crucial cog in his midfield. The Uruguayan has had some fitness issues of late but even so, he has started in just one of Arsenal’s last 13 league ties and didn’t make it off the bench in Saturday’s final. So, with Torreira still fairly young, having nearly three years of his contract left and seemingly interested in returning to Italy, perhaps it would be best if Arsenal shipped him out this summer in order to bring in someone like Thomas Partey, a player whom the Gunners have been linked with for some time now. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1206709565-1024x828.jpg?resize=1024%2C828&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 16: Lucas Torreira of Arsenal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Newcastle United at Emirates Stadium on February 16, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

The above statement is likely to cause a fair bit of divide amongst the Arsenal faithful but it does make sense. Since Bernd Leno’s injury vs Brighton, Martinez has stepped up in ways many at Arsenal probably assumed he was incapable of. The 27-year-old has pulled off some simply sensational stops in the last few months and whilst the sample size isn’t too big, Martinez does look to have proven he can be a Premier League No.1. So, when next season rolls around, will Martinez be happy to once again play second fiddle to Bernd Leno? And more importantly, can Arsenal really not afford to cash in on Martinez now he has proven he is capable of cutting it in the English top-flight. In an ideal world, Arteta would be able to pick and choose between Leno and Martinez, two top shot-stoppers. But in a world in which Arsenal look like they need to raise cash from player sales to fund transfers, selling Martinez, who is now likely to command a heftier fee after his recent displays, does make sense – especially when the Gunners already have a solid No.1 in Leno.
