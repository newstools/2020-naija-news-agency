A number of updates on Arsenal’s summer transfer plans have been forthcoming online over the last 24 hours, on the back of the club’s FA Cup triumph. Mikel Arteta’s men of course made the trip to Wembley on Saturday evening, for the final outing of an altogether underwhelming campaign. After seeing their Champions League hopes for next season crumble at the hands of Olympiacos back in February, the Gunners went on to stumble to an 8th-placed Premier League finish late last month. This meant that, ahead of kick-off 48 hours ago, the north Londoners were all too aware that their hopes of securing European football for the 2020/21 campaign (and the accompanying financial windfall) hung by a thread. As such, when Christian Pulisic handed Chelsea the lead with just 5 minutes on the clock, Arsenal’s fans and players alike no doubt feared the worst. This, though, is simply not the same side as the one previously headed by Unai Emery. The Gunners, rather than collapse, quickly regained their composure, to secure a foothold in proceedings in the capital. This eventually resulted in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pulling Arsenal level from the penalty spot shortly before the half-hour mark. And it wasn’t long before Mikel Arteta’s star man had turned the clash completely on its head. Midway through the 2nd-half, Aubameyang was picked out by Nicolas Pepe in the Chelsea box, with the Gabonese hitman having gone on to leave Kurt Zouma for dead, before dinking Willy Caballero with a wonderful finish, sealing Arsenal’s latest FA Cup title in the process. As such, things at the Emirates, all of a sudden, appear to be looking up. After being forced to face up to the very real possibility of another trophyless season with no European football on the horizon, the Gunners can instead now plan for a year in the Europa League, whilst donning the title of FA Cup champions. Crucially, this could also prove key to the club’s hopes of holding onto star man Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang beyond next summer. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1227874294-1024x666.jpg?resize=1024%2C666&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 01: Mikel Arteta manager of Arsenal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal pose with the trophy after the FA Cup Final match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Wembley Stadium on August 1, 2020 in London, England.

The capital giants are now expected to switch their attentions to the transfer market, as Mikel Arteta eyes up crucial reinforcements to his squad. And, according to the Times, 3 such potential arrivals in north London have already been identified. The trio in question come in the form of Philippe Coutinho, Willian and Thomas Partey. Gary Jacob suggests that Arteta is keen on adding experienced faces to his squad this summer, to aid the development of his young stars. The Arsenal boss is also eyeing a switch to a 4-3-3 system. Arsenal will try to capitalise on their FA Cup triumph by accelerating efforts to make signings and tie down Aubameyang and Martínez to new deals, reports @garyjacob #AFC https://t.co/rbgRpZFY5R — Times Sport (@TimesSport) August 3, 2020 Before the Emirates outfit begin planning for any big-money arrivals, however, they will likely first need to clear some of the deadwood from a bloated squad. An insight into this topic, meanwhile, has been provided by Sami Mokbel of the Daily Mail. The headline claim from Mokbel’s piece is that Arsenal are ready to part with as many as 9 first-team players this summer. The most high-profile names come in the form of Alexandre Lacazette and Hector Bellerin, though it is also hinted that any of Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Sead Kolasinac, Shkodran Mustafi or Rob Holding could be moved on. The Gunners are also keen to shift Mesut Ozil’s massive wages from their books, but are aware of how unlikely an outright sale looks as things stand. In terms of potential incomings, alongside the aforementioned trio, the Arsenal board are also thought to be keen to extend Dani Ceballos’ loan, as well as bring in another central defender.
