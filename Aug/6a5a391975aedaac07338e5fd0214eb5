The governor disclosed this on Saturday during a briefing on COVID-19 at the State House in Marina. While mosques will be reopened next week Friday, the governor said churches will follow suit on Sunday, August 9. According to him, religious leaders must make available hand sanitizer, thermometer guns, adding that the state government will ensure that social distancing is maintained. Places of worship in Lagos will now be opened from Friday, August 7 for our Muslim worshippers and on Sunday, August 9 for our Christian worshippers. We will only be allowing 50 per cent of their capacity at either the church or the mosque. Churches that have Saturday worship day will also be allowed to start holding their Saturday worship. He also said the state is winning the battle against the dreaded virus largely due to the increase in the number of tested samples. He said the last two weeks witnessed a decline in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. He said: We must, however, mention that we have seen a gradual decrease in the positivity rate in Lagos State over the last two weeks which combined with our increase in the testing numbers, points to a very encouraging picture of the outcome of our response strategy in the state. We will continue to fine-tune our strategy and our efforts to build on our successes and close all existing gaps if any. While noting that the state government successfully tested 9,000 samples in the week ending July 26, the governor explained the figures represented a 50 per cent increase in the 6,000 tested samples in the preceding week. He said more testing of suspected COVID-19 cases has been made possible with the creation of additional laboratories in the state.  View this post on Instagram  I am happy to announce the progress we are making in our fight against Covid-19 and the current decline in positive cases. In view of this development, we have taken the decision to reopen places of worship effective from Friday  August 7 for Muslim worshippers, and Sunday, August 9, for Christian worshippers with 50 per cent of their regular capacity.  In the same vein, social clubs and recreational centers will also open from August 14, in strict compliance with safety protocols and registration with Lagos State Safety Commission. Clearance certificates to open are at this time being issued only to social clubs with registered trustees. Restaurants can open for in-dining services from August 14, on the condition that they maintain 50 per cent capacity and obtain safety compliance certificate through the LSSC registration portal.  Public gatherings can now hold with a maximum of 50 persons for meetings, funerals and other social events. While we try to ensure that life gradually returns to normal, we implore residents to continue to use face masks in public spaces and adhere strictly to all the public health safety measures and guidelines. At this point, I have to emphasize how important and necessary it is for us to self-regulate. Everyone of us must take up the mantle of responsibility and ensure that we are self-regulating ourselves in our interest and in the interest of our loved ones.
