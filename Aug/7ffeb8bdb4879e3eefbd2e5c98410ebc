Updates on the potential impact of Arsenal’s FA Cup crown on the futures of Dani Ceballos and Thomas Partey have been forthcoming online over the last 24 hours. Mikel Arteta’s men visited Wembley yesterday evening, for an FA Cup final meeting with Chelsea. The matchup marked the Gunners’ final outing of the campaign, and offered them a 2nd chance at securing a European berth, after finishing in a lowly 8th-spot in the Premier League table. And, when all was said and done in the English capital, this is precisely what Arsenal managed. Chelsea actually took the lead on Saturday, when Chrisian Pulisic capitalised on some shoddy defending early on to slot home in style. Arsenal, though, were back on terms before long, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, after earning a penalty at the expense of Cesar Azpilicueta, dusted himself off to slot home with typical confidence. And the Gabonese hitman was back at it again a little over 20 minutes from time, dancing his way past Kurt Zouma before dinking a wonderful finish over Willy Caballero to secure a 2-1 win. As outlined above, meanwhile, on the back of their record-setting 14th FA Cup triumph, updates have been forthcoming on a pair of players who, if Arsenal have their way, will be plying their trade at the Emirates next season. First up is Dani Ceballos. Spanish midfielder Ceballos has stood as one of the key members of Mikel Arteta’s squad since English football’s resumption in June, with the 23-year-old having finally managed to showcase his talents on a consistent basis in north London. Arteta, in turn, recently confirmed that Arsenal are hopeful of keeping hold of Ceballos beyond the expiration of his loan deal later this month. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1201357290-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 16: Dani Ceballos of Arsenal reacts during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Newcastle United at Emirates Stadium on February 16, 2020 in London, United Kingdom.

And, though he was quick to label parent club Real Madrid the best in the world, the Spaniard also admitted that he is yet to make a decision on his plans for next season: ‘I haven’t spoken to Real Madrid yet, but anyone who wears that shirt is happy’, Ceballos explained during an interview with El Partidazo de COPE. ‘Madrid are better than any club in the world. We’ll see about my future.’ ‘I’m not thinking about whether or not I can play for Real Madrid, Arsenal or another club.’ ‘Now it’s time to disconnect. I have to be calm and think clearly with my family about the coming year.’ Next up comes an update on Arsenal’s pursuit of Thomas Partey. The north Londoners have long been named as keen admirers of the Atletico Madrid standout, who has emerged as a prime target for Mikel Arteta ahead of next season. The one major stumbling block in any Gunners swoop, however, is the price-tag involved. Partey’s contract at the Wanda Metropolitano is known to possess a €50 million release clause. Though such a fee would likely actually prove a bargain for any club willing to pay up, Arsenal are simply not thought to be in the financial situation to fork over such a sum at present. And this stance, according to Spanish journalist David Vinuesa Malbac (who has extensively covered Arsenal’s Partey pursuit of late) has not changed on the back of the club’s FA Cup final win. It is claimed that the capital giants have made clear to Atletico that they will not meet their midfield star’s release clause, with the Rojiblancos unwilling to negotiate a lower fee. As such, a deal, as things stand, remains completely off the table. Que el Arsenal entre en la Europa League vía FA Cup no cambia nada en la situación de Thomas. Cuando el Arsenal comunicó al Atlético que no pagaría su cláusula contaban con ganar la FA Cup. El Atlético no negocia y el Arsenal no pagará los 50 millones.
