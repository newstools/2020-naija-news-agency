Speculation in the English media this weekend suggests that Leicester City are the latest Premier League club expressing an interest in the signature of Odsonne Edouard. Edouard, a 22-year-old striker, has been on the books of Scottish champions Celtic since the summer of 2017. And, over the course of the last 3 years, the PSG youth product has gone on to establish himself as one of, if not the most highly-regarded young talent in Scotland. After impressing during a loan stint in Glasgow during the 2017-18 campaign, Celtic unsurprisingly opted to make Edouard’s signing permanent, with the Frenchman having been the man chosen to replace Moussa Dembele at Parkhead. And to say that Edouard has since managed to fill the sizable boots of his fellow countryman would be putting it lightly. Last season saw the gifted hitman rack up a hugely impressive 27 goals, to go along with 19 assists, across all competitions. And Celtic’s opening fixture of the new SPL campaign earlier today saw Edouard continue to dazzle, en route to a hat-trick vs Hamilton: Celtic set a marker in their pursuit of a 10th successive Scottish Premiership title as Odsonne Edouard’s hat-trick helped them trounce Hamilton 5-1 at Parkhead in their opening game of the season. — Sky Sports Scotland (@ScotlandSky) August 2, 2020 As such, Edouard’s stellar production has inevitably seen the 22-year-old named as a target for some of European football’s heavyweights. Recent months have seen the likes of Manchester United and Everton both tipped to swoop for the Celtic star, though the outfit most persistently tipped as a potential landing spot have been Arsenal. And, as outlined above, if the latest speculation stemming from the media today is to be believed, then yet another English club have now positioned themselves in the race for Edouard’s signature. The side in question? Leicester City. The Foxes, as per the Daily Mail, are on the hunt for attacking reinforcements ahead of next season, having missed out on a top-4 berth in agonising fashion last month. Manager Brendan Rodgers previously worked with Edouard whilst at Celtic, and now appears to be eyeing a reunion with his former hitman. Opening up funds for the Frenchman’s potential arrival at the King Power, meanwhile, would be the summer sale of Kelechi Iheanacho. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1052758984-1024x707.jpg?resize=1024%2C707&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LONDON, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 22: Kelechi Iheanacho of Leicester City kicks the ball past Rob Holding of Arsenal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Leicester City at Emirates Stadium on October 22, 2018 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) Though he managed a respectable 10 goals across all competitions this past season, former Manchester City man Iheanacho has seemingly been deemed surplus to requirements at Leicester, with a departure ahead of the 2020/21 campaign looking increasingly likely. One potential landing spot touted for the Nigerian is Aston Villa, with Dean Smith’s men no doubt keen to add a proven Premier League goalscorer to their ranks, having recently avoided a swift return to the Championship by the skin of their teeth.
