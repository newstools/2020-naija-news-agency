It’s not that the directors are the one taking advantage of them. Even the so-called girls as well come in making themselves vulnerable to the producers to get roles fast. So it takes two to tango.” Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
