Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has confirmed that Arthur looks set to face legal action, after refusing to return to the club in anticipation of the resumption of their Champions League campaign. On the back of the COVID-19 pandemic, finances available to clubs on the transfer market this summer are expected to take a heavy hit. This, in turn, has seen swap deals widely explored, as sides across Europe prepare for the 2020/21 campaign with slashed budgets at their disposal. One such exchange to not only have gained traction, but actually already been completed, meanwhile, came between Juventus and Barcelona. In a somewhat bizarre transfer late in June, the Bianconeri and Blaugrana agreed to swap midfield stars, with Miralem Pjanic making the move to the Camp Nou, whilst Arthur heads in the opposite direction. (The complex financial details involved in the deal are explained brilliantly here by the reliable Swiss Ramble.)

The Old Lady did fork out an extra €12 million when compared to Barcelona, but landed themselves an unquestionable talent in the process, whilst moving on an aging midfielder fresh off a difficult season. Whilst all at the Allianz Stadium unsurprisingly appeared enthusiastic regarding pushing a deal through as a result, one individual who was not so keen was Arthur himself. The Brazilian international repeatedly spoke of his love for Barcelona, having been determined to prove himself at the Camp Nou. In the end, though, he was essentially forced out of the club. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-1021898194-1024x701.jpg?resize=1024%2C701&#038;ssl=1" alt="Heung-min Son and Arthur" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Heung-min Son and Arthur during the International Champions Cup 2018 match at Rose Bowl on July 28, 2018 in Pasadena, California. And, as outlined above, Barca’s poor treatment of their midfield star looks as though it could result in a messy final parting of ways. Though he has already penned a deal with Juventus, Arthur is not actually due to link up with the Italian champions until next season. The South American was therefore expected to see out the remainder of his soon-to-be former side’s Champions League campaign. As such, it no doubt came as a major source of concern for Quique Setien and co. when word arrived earlier this week that Arthur had come to the decision not to return to Catalunya following the completion of the La Liga campaign. The 23-year-old has instead opted to remain in his home country of Brazil. Barcelona themselves, though, are evidently not prepared to accept Arthur going AWOL without a fight. Speaking in an interview with SPORT earlier today, Josep Maria Bartomeu was drawn on the situation, with the Blaugrana president having slammed the former Gremio man for his ‘unjustifiable behaviour’: ‘What Arthur has done shows a lack of respect for his team-mates because the team wants to do well in the Champions League.’ ‘It is not logical that playing for such an important title, a player decides to remove himself. It is unjustifiable and totally incomprehensible.’ ‘We reached the agreement that until the Champions League ended he would continue playing for Barca, both in the league and in the Champions League. He is a player who has a certain importance in the team and who could help us.’ Bartomeu was then questioned on the possible repercussions of Arthur’s actions. And the Spaniard went on to confirm that Barcelona now intend to take legal action, in a potential case of breach of contract: ‘But he did not appear from the return of the mini-vacations. It is an unacceptable act of indiscipline. And that is why we have opened a file for him, because there is no argument to justify his absence.’ ‘He called and said, ‘I will not return, I will stay in Brazil’. It is his decision. No one has given him permission.’ Cristiano Ronaldo all but confirms Juventus future Pochettino on Tottenham mistakes, turning down Real Madrid and possibility of taking over at Barcelona Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
