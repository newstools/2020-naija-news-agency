Bruno Fernandes has today secured the latest in a growing list of individual prizes, after playing a central role in Manchester United’s Premier League endeavours last month. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men took to the pitch in the Premier League on 6 occasions in July. And, despite having seen their previously stellar form largely fizzle out, the Red Devils nevertheless managed to finish out their campaign on a high. 4 wins and 2 draws eventually proved enough to secure a 3rd-placed finish in the English top-flight, with the Manchester giants set to take their place back in the Champions League for the 2020/21 campaign as a result. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1259082838-1024x727.jpg?resize=1024%2C727&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> LEICESTER, ENGLAND – JULY 26: Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United celebrates after scoring the opening goal from the penalty spot during the Premier League match between Leicester City and Manchester United at The King Power Stadium on July 26, 2020 in Leicester, England.Football Stadiums around Europe remain empty due to the Coronavirus Pandemic as Government social distancing laws prohibit fans inside venues resulting in all fixtures being played behind closed doors.

The player in question? Bruno Fernandes. In something of a surprise a short time ago, it was confirmed that Portuguese midfielder Fernandes has been named the PFA Fans’ Player of the Month. While the 25-year-old has of course dazzled since his arrival at Old Trafford in January, July (the latter half of the month in particular) actually saw Fernandes struggle somewhat, with the former Sporting man having evidently been on the verge of a complete burnout. Nevertheless, Fernandes still managed 3 goals and 4 assists across 6 Premier League appearances, enough to see him beat out the likes of Michail Antonio and Raheem Sterling to be crowned the PFA’s best: Congratulations to @B_Fernandes8!
