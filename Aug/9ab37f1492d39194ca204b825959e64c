Liverpool are “very likely” to sign Thiago Alcantara this summer, according to reports in Spain. Thiago has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool recently. The midfielder is unsettled at Bayern Munich, and could be one of the few missing pieces to be added to Liverpool’s title winning squad. While Liverpool are yet to meet Bayern’s asking price, they have reportedly managed to convince the player. With his contract in Munich up next year, Thiago is ready to move on. Things have since progressed, with Mundo Deportivo now claiming that Thiago is “very likely” to join Liverpool. The Premier League champions will have to pay €30m for the Spaniard’s signature. But the Catalan source claims the ex-Barcelona player is destined for Anfield. Thiago has now told Bayern that he wants to leave. And Liverpool are the only team mentioned as a potential suitor. Jurgen Klopp has previously been coy on Liverpool’s links with Thiago. The Reds boss has described the 29-year-old as a “great player”, but has refused to say whether or not Thiago will be at Anfield next season. He told Sky Sports Germany recently:“I have no idea who will play for me next year, there is nothing to say at the moment. “Thiago Alcantara is a great player, but also a Bayern Munich player. So that’s it, I’ve actually said everything. There is nothing to say about it!” The post Spanish report claims Liverpool ‘very likely’ to sign Thiago appeared first on Football365.
